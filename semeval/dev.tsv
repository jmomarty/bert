guid	0	smth	Please feel free to contact me directly regarding this.
guid	0	smth	Thank you very much, great phone !
guid	0	smth	You're alienating your developers with this stuff and to be honest, it's just unacceptable.

guid	0	smth	There is no exposed SelectBox control as far as it appears, even though it is used in Microsoft's apps like Settings.
guid	1	smth	There should be a way to test applications on real devices without registering in the app hub, because a private person, perhaps, develops an application over a long time and so he pays 99$ each year, only that he can test the application on his mobile.

guid	0	smth	"Like other platforms are having the option for ""USB Debugging""."
guid	0	smth	Some power hungry tasks are high priority and should run as soon as external power is available, not wait an hour while the battery charges to 90%.

guid	1	smth	Don't define restrictions for developers.
guid	0	smth	It should be able to recur but to save battery it could be limited to daily.
guid	0	smth	UX is much better and
guid	0	smth	I request that the MultiScaleImage library to be able to access isolated storage.
guid	0	smth	Also, why pay data charges to view the same image over and over [aren___t music & photo libraries stored on phones?]
guid	0	smth	If a user wants an application to host content, whether it be 1GB of music or 1GB of image tiles for a needed application that should be their prerogative.
guid	0	smth	Some suggest that large images (even broken into tiles) are inappropriate for storage on a phone ___ that___ more

guid	1	smth	The only way around this is for the control vendor to throw every single class that might be used in XAML (not just controls but other types too), in the same namespace, creating a very ugly unwieldy API to code against.

guid	1	smth	"Winjs could be modernized, streamlined and simplified as part of the open source project by providing only that functionality not now supported by ES6."""
guid	0	smth	Edge Browser, VS 2015 and VS Code already provides support for ES6.
guid	0	smth	My Lumia 920 micro-usb port just broke so I need to deploy via wifi or bluethoot.
guid	0	smth	While most organizations will allow in-store apps, it's still going to be very inconvenient to deploy apps through the app store for many reasons.

guid	0	smth	For example I am currently not able to edit any of my IAP descriptions translated to 14 languages because they exceed the 200 characters limit.
guid	0	smth	This would surely make the integration with Direct2D content much easier.

guid	1	smth	Include gestures that could allow users minimize apps for example with three fingers.
guid	1	smth	Prevent full-trust apps from targeting phone and Xbox if you have to.
guid	1	smth	Maybe a new ValidationMode type would make sense here.
guid	1	smth	Can you add the 3D Viewer object that is used by Paint 3D and Mixed Reality Viewer?
guid	1	smth	But it would be nice to choose what elements get discarded first in case there's isn't enough space on the tile.
guid	1	smth	Would be a lot more intuitive useful and less distractive then the current overlay.
guid	1	smth	It would be nice to have a UWP(or Xamarin) Community Tutorial where devs can contribute to the tutorial and make it up to date.
guid	1	smth	Create a Cordova plugin to enable IOS and Android hybrid apps to use Project Rome features.
guid	1	smth	For events the target method must not be overloaded.
guid	1	smth	Can we please improve the situation by adding missing API
guid	1	smth	The closet option is to launch it FullScreen but that obscures the task bar.
guid	1	smth	It would be nice to be able to easily create rounded or circular buttons in UWP without creating custom control template.
guid	0	smth	There are design toolkits available for several designer programs at https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/design/downloads/index.
guid	0	smth	It appears that garbage data (from the stack I assume) is being used for the value `curInlineLength`.
guid	0	smth	Call stack: https://hastebin.com/legulilabu
guid	0	smth	Unfortunately I can not since this is limited through Windows.
guid	0	smth	As a developer I'm always in the Dev Dashboard.
guid	0	smth	Note you cannot see files/images attached to the item
guid	0	smth	Since the SemanticZoom is subscribed to the BackRequested event if I navigate to another page and press the back button the BackRequested event is not called on my navigated page since it is handled by the SemanticZoom in the previous page even if page caching is disabled for the Frame.
guid	0	smth	I reproduced this on Mobile Emulator 10.0.14393.0 WXGA 4.5 inch 1GB and on a Lumia 640 running 10.0.15063.1088.
guid	0	smth	Tested in both c++ and c#.
guid	0	smth	Windows is literally the only platform that restricts musicians in this way.
guid	0	smth	All with the same original and translated text for all languages!
guid	0	smth	It is pretty annoying having to duplicate lots or resources just becase the same command has now moved to a different control.
guid	0	smth	Swiping a SwipeControl item from the right to the left will reveal the options on the right (as if dragging the item to the left revealing options behind it.
guid	0	smth	I appreciate that swipe controls have come out of developments around touch interfaces.
guid	0	smth	Outlook for example utilises a SwipeControl type arrangement (that can be interacted with using a mouse) for marking emails as read or unread (among other things).
guid	0	smth	In order to download the Windows Driver Kit I must first install Visual Studio 2017.
guid	0	smth	In the saved image the headers in the PDF pages are not rendered.
guid	0	smth	In my enterprise application basically a sales and purchase application.
guid	0	smth	But RenderTargetBitmap API doesn't work in Background.
guid	0	smth	These are the APIs that ought to be allowed in UWP when codeGeneration is permitted:
guid	0	smth	Many applications need only Desktop support.
guid	0	smth	It should have been 2018-02-07 16:06 (or later)
guid	0	smth	(AF_UNIX ANCILLARY MMAP and many others ) within Docker.
guid	0	smth	So what is the suggestion?
guid	0	smth	A good web example can be found here
guid	0	smth	There are thousands of programmists here too.
guid	0	smth	Setting ProtextedText to On doesn't work the selected text is still modifiable.
guid	0	smth	I'm currently trying to convert an application that contains some of the CoreUtils utilities (most notably [.exe and ].exe).
guid	0	smth	Preparing Virtual File System
guid	0	smth	VERBOSE: An error occurred converting your application.
guid	0	smth	What does the Desktop Bridge do differently?
guid	0	smth	At first this isn't an issue since the control isn't Visible.
guid	0	smth	This was probably done as a performance optimization; however binding needs to recognize visibility changes if it won't bind when an item is not visible in the UI.
guid	0	smth	Am even stock now  I would be glad if you can update it now.
guid	0	smth	When setting ToolTipService.Placement to Mouse the text in the tooltip is no longer sharp.
guid	0	smth	It now gets a number of linker problems that are being caused by Microsoft components.
guid	0	smth	Current appextension only supports loading assets and scripts.
guid	0	smth	In full screen transport controls (not video) do also respect the safe area.
guid	0	smth	Nevertheless so far this is ok and could be called as expected.
guid	0	smth	There are many threads on Internet discussing this issue but Windows Store team doesn't seem to listen.
guid	0	smth	For this reason apps programmed in JavaScript that use Video or photo capturing are from now on non-functional in Windows 10.
guid	0	smth	And 50 objects that are triangle meshes (TM)
guid	0	smth	SP don't do depth writes but they do depth-tests and depth reads in the shader.
guid	0	smth	That way would be very beneficial:
guid	0	smth	See GitHub issue for more information and scenarios (https://github.com/Microsoft/WindowsUIDevLabs/issues/239)
guid	0	smth	At least we're not totally in the dark in a limbo where we don't know if the issue is just a transient one or a serious one and we have to way days.
guid	0	smth	At least we're not totally in the dark in a limbo where we don't know if the issue is just a transient one orâ¦ more
guid	0	smth	Three days is not fast enough forâ¦ more
guid	0	smth	so all our secondary tiles grouped automatically???!!!!
guid	0	smth	will waste in performance.
guid	0	smth	However being able to tie this data with revenue data is limited as transaction data can only be downloaded by CSV through the Payout Summary page.
guid	0	smth	We are talking page load times of several minutes in many cases.
guid	0	smth	I'm looking to use ECDH key agreement in an universal windows app but I can't find a way to do so.
guid	0	smth	I don't see this limitation documentated anywhere (but I might have missed it).
guid	0	smth	I understand WinAppDriver does not currently support WebView and therefore it does not support context switching so /context command is not provided.
guid	0	smth	 The problem I found is that it currently shows a UI dialog asking for current loged in user credentials confirmation.
guid	0	smth	(Event registration order doesn't seem to make a difference)
guid	0	smth	The following will reliably throw some flavor of interop exception:
guid	0	smth	ApplicationView.SuppressSystemOverlays has been deprecated for a while and the warning message says use TryEnterFullScreenMode instead.
guid	0	smth	When you use full screen mode StatusBar.ShowAsync doesn't work.
guid	0	smth	But we turn the status bar back to visible along with other playback controls when the user taps the screen.
guid	0	smth	Sure we could replace the status bar with our own UI containing the same info.
guid	0	smth	This new model of develpement can be used for both windows and web applciations.
guid	0	smth	As soon this gets in to market due to the ease of development this should boom which eventually kill browser like chrome there angular concept thus again giving Microsoft a opportunity to beat others
guid	0	smth	Tested on Windows 10 Creators Update VS2017 15.2.
guid	0	smth	The auto-exposure function causes major headaches for the app I'm working on and I would dearly love to be able to turn it off.
guid	0	smth	(Ofcourse I'm using Windwos 10 Creators Update Version.)
guid	0	smth	It would save the user a lot of time and effort.
guid	0	smth	Future access list is great in theory but adds too much overhead.
guid	0	smth	Currently UWP can't open WASAPI output devices in capture mode due to COM restrictions.
guid	0	smth	Background audio playback working on Build 14393 does not work on Build 15063.
guid	0	smth	After releasing the pointer or finger the list abruptly return to position 0 and the refresh indicator is hidden
guid	0	smth	For consistency sakes requesting same from all async awaitable(s).
guid	0	smth	Without APIs you are losing customers to Android/iOS as many people would love to have apps which can control their volume system theme etc.
guid	0	smth	 ** Currently the Pivot has no overflow-panel.
guid	0	smth	Today we're using WPF for these tasks.
guid	0	smth	However once a user launch the main app ui and close it appservice is also terminated (because both shared same process).
guid	0	smth	Related to feature request :
guid	0	smth	Use case: As neither Groove nor Spotify have a lyrics functionality (anymore) I created a simple UWP app to manage lyrics for songs.
guid	0	smth	I'm developing a Windows Universal App and I'm sicked and tired of finding a way to implement encrypted local DB support.
guid	0	smth	I can't understand why I'm confused in this situation which is possible on Android or iOS so easy.
guid	0	smth	Notice animated GIFs appear.
guid	0	smth	More interestingly transcoding other files to ALAC works fine.
guid	0	smth	Having a good informed answer to this question will help tremendously in helping us understand how to proceed.
guid	0	smth	A user may change his review completely and the original response could become totally irrelevant.
guid	0	smth	Iâm using the property DeviceInformation::Name in my application to display the port name.
guid	0	smth	Warning 4668 is an extra one we have enabled beyond warning level 4.
guid	0	smth	I can see the tasks but I can't terminate them
guid	0	smth	Many users still complains about given volume even fade in doesn't save the situation.
guid	0	smth	It's also a total annoyance when working with data that require handling of lotsâ¦ more
guid	0	smth	I really hope this will change in the near future because for Pro Audio applications something really has to change.
guid	0	smth	DownloadOperation (BackgroundTransfer API) restarts from 0 when resumed after being paused at 100% (progress.bytesReceived == progress.totalBytesToReceive and startAsync task hasn't completed).
guid	0	smth	PS: I cannot try to create the folders in advance because each time the converter generates and uses a new GUID.
guid	0	smth	The visual feedback was disabled!

guid	1	smth	If the enumeration are updated with the latest MDL2 glyphs it may helps many of developers who search the correct glyphs.
guid	1	smth	Introduce Userchoice Dialog if AccessException is raised.
guid	1	smth	I would propose adding the ability for the SplitView pane to be opened by swiping in from the left side of the screen.
guid	1	smth	There should be a native way for developers to omit their app from being able to show a preview when hovered over in the taskbar as well as preventing the screenshot that is visible in the recent apps section (on mobile).
guid	1	smth	Do the minimum to create an instance of a TCP service and add a text attribute with a key-value pair
guid	1	smth	Add a UserNotificationChangedTriggerDetails to UserNotificationChangedTrigger background task with at least:
guid	1	smth	I'd also LOVE to see better extension/entrypoint/OS integration similar to App-v.
guid	1	smth	Launcher.LaunchFolderAsync should accept a StorageFile as first argument.
guid	0	smth	With mouse flyout opens on right click which is ok.
guid	0	smth	An API that would take 5 minutes for someone to write up and save me a lot of coding
guid	1	smth	However it would be even better if it allowed users with the developer role to create app packages in Visual Studio.
guid	0	smth	To wrap this up: I really have faith in what Microsoft and doing and Cortana while it needs improvement it can prove to be a great competitor that what's out in the market but being limited to few regions it just not useful and that sucks.

guid	1	smth	hile this is possible with CompositionSurface i feel it is needed on the Image Control as well
guid	0	smth	verything is fine up until that point but if you want to serialize that class so that you can store it and load it directly instead of traversing the filesystem and opening up each file to read its ID3 tags every time you open the app (which can be a lot of unnecessary work especially for larger libraries) (or so you can send which book to play to an audio background task) you really don't have many options
