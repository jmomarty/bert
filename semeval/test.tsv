guid	1	smth	I'm not asking Microsoft to Gives permission like Android so any app can take my data, but don't keep it restricted like iPhone.
guid	0	smth	somewhere between Android and iPhone.
guid	0	smth	And in the Windows Store you can flag the App [Requires Trust] for example.
guid	0	smth	Many thanks Sameh Hi, As we know, there is a lot of limitations is WP8 OS due the high security in the OS itself which is very good, but some time we need to allow some apps to do extra works, apps which we trust i.e: hotmail app, facebook app, skype app ....
guid	1	smth	The idea is that we can develop a regular app and we request our permissions in the manifest, OR the app can ASK FOR TRUST_æ_ more
guid	1	smth	Please add this simple and extremely helpful feature.
guid	1	smth	Why not let us have several pages that we can put tiles on and name whatever we want to .
guid	1	smth	The Idea is if user running our app and by any reason he rebooted the phone so in that case once reboot happen there should be some event so that we can detect that phone is rebooted and we can handle our application accordingly
guid	1	smth	Add support for the biometric framework from windows 7/8 to allow hardware manufactures to add fingerprint sensors for device login (login allows standard user & guest/kid mode) and for wallet (WP8) transaction activation.
guid	1	smth	It would be more natural to allow the physical search key to activate the search function on the active application, rather than loading Bing which is rarely the goal.
guid	1	smth	Allow platform built-in camera and video apps to use increase and decrease volume hardware keys for picture optical and digital zoom of camera.
guid	1	smth	On WP8 add optional support to hook these hardware keys press events for the lens (plug-in) features...hardware keys should include vol+, vol-, stage 1 (light press) camera shutter, stage 2 (deep press) camera shutter.
guid	1	smth	I believe there needs to be a marking system in the OS like the option of marking several emails in the pop mails.
guid	1	smth	If I intend to delete several files(photos, songs) there should be an easier way to do it.
guid	1	smth	You can put other apps in one folder, and put on startscreen like a tile.
guid	0	smth	This is total uncomfortably, i think about give to user, a choose what he want to bind on search button.
guid	0	smth	It would be awesome.
guid	1	smth	Make it so that you have to enter a password for apps of your choice
guid	0	smth	Big files can't be transfered using skydrive, it is not praticle!
guid	1	smth	It would be an improvement if they displayed as graphic Smilies instead.
guid	1	smth	The UserControl should run in the context of the application that created the Alarm or Reminder, and as such would have access to the appropriate view models.
guid	1	smth	Need an option to remove unused variables in cs file for re factoring.
guid	1	smth	Use the usb as removeable disk
guid	1	smth	Pls introduce pattern lockscreen like android.
guid	0	smth	Only after repairing the installation will the emulator work.
guid	0	smth	If I close the emulator and try to run it again.
guid	0	smth	It fails with a uninformative message indicating deployment failed.
guid	0	smth	information on the screen locked, temperature, news of facebook and Twitter and lock with letters and numbers
guid	0	smth	Search text
guid	1	smth	"I wish api's for save photos in camera roll in png format; not only as ""lossy"" jpeg format."
guid	1	smth	Having native access to OpenCL or C++ AMP support would be nice to have, especially with the newer hardware arriving with WP8.
guid	0	smth	Please help me I'm Ahmed from Iraq I wanna get Arabic keyboard in my WP please !!!
guid	0	smth	When an application has problems or when a problem is detected in advance by the developer, until the publication of the correction version the client is without knowing what is happening.
guid	0	smth	This way we can give a satisfaction to all who buy or evaluate our applications.
guid	1	smth	This communication channel can use the Bing Translator to generate the statement in the languages in which the application has been translated.
guid	0	smth	I believe it is a feature that will cherish Microsoft to customers and that demonstrates respect for the consumer.
guid	0	smth	In some cases missing answer key after unlock, when phone is locked, also missing call alert network enable/disable (network code is *#43# for verify, *43# for enable and #43# for disable).
guid	1	smth	What I am asking for is some key that will act like the Screenshot->Capture command without me having to change tabs in the Emulator window or release the Accelerometer.
guid	1	smth	Even something as simple as ctrl+S would be a godsend for me.
guid	1	smth	If I am lucky I can do it before my character dies, even then though the player is just moving in a straight line to nowhere_æ_ more
guid	1	smth	"Please allow users to view ""comments"" in office docs i.e word, ppt, excel....also allow user to add comments on these docs"
guid	1	smth	Provide a single link to retrieve all the applications by a specific Publisher like the Android Market.
guid	1	smth	Please show the scrollbars in the WebBrowser control.
guid	0	smth	There are times when this is greatly needed!
guid	0	smth	The other smartphone platforms like Android, iOS and Blackberry supports launching one App from another and passing data between them.
guid	0	smth	This is really important when a same organisation develops multiple apps and wants them to interact with each other.
guid	0	smth	If this feature will be implemented without affecting the security model of WP, then it will be great for the WP developer world.
guid	0	smth	I keep getting birthday notifications a day too early.
guid	0	smth	the date in the peoplehub does not align with the calendar.
guid	0	smth	With WP7 we have the unique ability to offer Trails for Paid Apps, which is great.
guid	1	smth	However, it would be nice if developers could offer Free Apps with a possibility to users for voluntary donations.
guid	0	smth	Some devs do the workaround and offer a Paid app, with the trial version having no restrictions at all (if the user clicks 'buy', he essentially donates to the dev).
guid	0	smth	However, this workaround has the disadvantage of the app not apprearing in the 'free' category, though they are actually free.
guid	1	smth	Therefore, it would be great if devs could put apps in the marketplace offering two buttons: 'install (free)' and 'install and donate (e.g.0,99$)'.
guid	1	smth	The price could be splitted 30-70 just like with paid apps, just with the difference of the app appearing in the 'free' category.
guid	0	smth	The current process is very lengthy and costly for non US developers.
guid	0	smth	Why can't Microsoft simplify it?
guid	1	smth	Make it similar if not the same as Google!?!?!
guid	0	smth	Having read through the cumbersome process, I am more incline to build FREE apps with subscription rather than getting any money through the Marketplace.
guid	0	smth	Having to deal with physical paperwork (sending it back and forth) is a step backwards... we are living in a digital world!
guid	1	smth	There are heaps and HEAPS of really good developers outside of US who really want to contribute to making Windows Phone a preferred choice, so please Microsoft; make it simplier and make it DIGITAL!
guid	1	smth	It would be really helpful if, for example, a developer makes an app that takes advantage of the schedule alarm API, and would like to enable the user to select a custom ringtone for that alarm.
guid	0	smth	This API proposal would enable the user to select from many ringtones already available on the phone, and save developers the trouble of having to implement their own custom ringtones.
guid	0	smth	"If you try to copy-paste multiple recipient number to the ""To:"" box in the messaging, the 2nd until the last number will be duplicated."
guid	0	smth	Even as a developer we can create most of the apps for individual users that is standalone.
guid	1	smth	If we need to target corporates then then we would need more APIs for device management, also like Zune (for a single user), we would need an Enterprise Server Application which can control the devices (of employees) remotely where we can apply corporate policies on the device as well.
guid	1	smth	Make some usefull app that run ussd code....
guid	1	smth	Please allow the access to Gmail's Todo list sync when a google account is added on the windows phone.
guid	1	smth	Under calendar I see the todo list of hotmail and I like it, it would be great if I can add the gmail's ones too and have the ability to make changes when sync happens or just have the ability to add todo items and those get sync to the phone.
guid	0	smth	Hi, the biggest icon size requited is 200x200 bit in the Marketplace single App page this is resized to 240x240 losing quality.
guid	0	smth	You can't add/update/delete alarms or reminders from a BackgroundAgent.
guid	1	smth	It'd be great if we at least has the ability to change/edit reminders and alarms that were created by that app.
guid	0	smth	And I want to get that response to my app to hanle it.
guid	1	smth	It would be very useful to be able to change the names that my apps appear as when I check the App Hub dashboard.
guid	1	smth	Developers must be given additional enumeration values in Socketype and ProtocolType to create variety of sockets like raw sockets based on ICMP, IGMP... etc.
guid	1	smth	Allow to create Alert and Reminder from Background Task execution.
guid	1	smth	"Allow Orientation=""horizontal"" on a listbox I would like to use the selectionchanged event handler to create a menu using the listbox control."
guid	1	smth	As the heading says provide tools to prevent users from reinstalling apps rather than buy the full version and stop devs from being deprived of purchases that they deserve.
guid	1	smth	As half the point of my app is the information on the live tile, I'd like to have a polite reminder show every so often if they haven't pinned it, but I simply don't know whether they have or not.
guid	1	smth	Disable the feature entirely.
guid	1	smth	Detect when there is a screen shot attempt so we can programmatically not display, obscure, or watermark our graphics.
guid	1	smth	Like Android we need Phone level events like (SMS received/sent event, Camera ON/OFF event, Phone turned ON/OFF event, Keypad lock event etc.)
guid	1	smth	"I would like a ""phone remote"" in windows 8."
guid	1	smth	Once a application is installed in WP, there should be some way to run that application without user input i.e.
guid	0	smth	Specifically, we will want the ability to have selective enabling of application features so that when the WP7 are run (after server-side conversion?)
guid	0	smth	on newer hardware, they switch to the newer profile.
guid	1	smth	Barring that, at least allow for merged listings for WP7 and WP8 versions so that customers have a clear upgrade path for the same application.
guid	1	smth	Or, you could just support the native SDK/Direct X on WP7.
guid	0	smth	I'll take that over the previous two.
guid	1	smth	Barring that, at least allow for merged listings for WP7 and WP8 versions so that customers have a clear upgrade path for_æ_ more
guid	0	smth	The concept explains itself well in below blogpost: WinRT Transitions _æ_ Creating Fast and Fluid Metro UIs http://www.scottlogic.co.uk/blog/colin/2011/10/winrt-transitions-creating-fast-and-fluid-metro-uis/
guid	0	smth	Using Vodafone GSM and the used data includes Unicode characters thus whole message is failed.
guid	0	smth	i could imagine, that in the same way the sms-icon is shown on the lockscreen, a 'mini app icon' is shown aswell, from apps that got notifications (facebbok, whatsapp....)
guid	1	smth	Add an option to delete future appointment in Calendar and preserve previous, when used the option to repeat
guid	1	smth	Platform should provide access to call log so you can create applications which for example retrive unknown numbers from call log and find their information from public directories.
guid	1	smth	The customized unlock apps are very popular on android and symbian, we hope that we could do the same on WP7.
guid	0	smth	At the moment, there is 1-to-1 relation between companies and countries.
guid	0	smth	It's OK for small business but what about bigger one?
guid	0	smth	We have several dev-centers in 3 countries and extra sales-offices in more countries.
guid	0	smth	Same time, WP7 registration intends we MUST use 1 country only.
guid	0	smth	These descriptions also appear differently depending on where they are being viewed (web, zune on PC or device).
guid	0	smth	The Update Description field has a documented purpose, but then in the forums I read that this field does not appear in the Marketplace.
guid	0	smth	Please provide a way to 1) predictably introduce newlines into the description fields 2) let me see how these fields will render in the different environments (WYSIWYG) 3) show me how the Update Description will be used in my updated app There does not seem to be a way to control newlines in the application descriptions on the Marketplace.
guid	1	smth	Please provide a way to 1) predictably introduce newlines into the description fields 2) let me see how these fields will render in the different environments (WYSIWYG) 3) show me how the Update Description will be used in my updated_æ_ more
guid	0	smth	Quicker way to go to the bottom of the metro screen to view tons of pined apps.
guid	0	smth	I currently develop for Android and iOS.
guid	0	smth	I am interested in developing for Windows Phone, but would need a device, to pay registration and learn a 3rd platform to do so.
guid	0	smth	That involves a lot of time, which is a large risk to smaller development companies.
guid	1	smth	If Microsoft created some incentives, like a free device (Blackberry did this) and a free year of membership (Amazon did this) it could drive a lot of developers to the platform which is crucial to the platform taking off.
guid	1	smth	I would jump at the opportunity to adapt my apps for Windows Phone if Microsoft created incentives for me to try the platfrom.
guid	0	smth	Cant use keyboard in landscape mode in some app
guid	0	smth	You would finally be able to add and customize your alert and text sounds!
guid	0	smth	Of course each app would have permission accepted by user and each app would have own isolated storage for more private.
guid	1	smth	It would be nice to see Windows Phone move to optional vector based icons instead of static bitmaps.
guid	0	smth	This would allow the application bar (or appbar) to resize if say HD screens were added.
guid	0	smth	Ideally, users would only need 2 icons for the marketplace: 'Tile' (contains the application name), and 'List' (just the icon for the app list).
guid	0	smth	Appbars could be created at 48x48 and resized as needed.
guid	1	smth	I know this is a pain on developers that are not designers or have designers, but an option would be nice time saver for the future.
guid	1	smth	It would be nice to be able to delete a cert you have uploaded.
guid	1	smth	I'd like to be able to decorate my home screen by pinning my favorite photos, directly from within the pictures application.
guid	1	smth	Allow users to organize tiles into separate hubs.
guid	1	smth	A secondary start hub I can use to store occasionally used apps would be good.
guid	1	smth	An automated hub for recently used apps would also be good.
guid	1	smth	Please allow the access to phone filesystem.
guid	1	smth	It would be a great benefit if the developers can manipulate the sdcard resources etc etc.
guid	0	smth	HP have the ePrint functionality, Apple the Airprint.
guid	0	smth	Can you not make connection to these devices possible?
guid	0	smth	I want to give a textbox a placeholder text.
guid	0	smth	This now requires creating a custom control.
guid	0	smth	I want this to be available out of the box.
guid	0	smth	Oh, and I want the option to create labels for the textbox.
guid	1	smth	Provide the access to pictures in PhotoChooser and Camera Roll in emulator
guid	0	smth	Since the easiest way to get hold of files to be used in programs is by downloading them from a network or the internet and saving them in isolated storage it would make the whole thing a lot easier if you could do this with FTP.
guid	0	smth	FTP is still one of the most used protocols for retrieving files.
guid	0	smth	And using a proxy is not always an options since some of us would like to be able to reach FTP servers that is on a separate network.
guid	0	smth	"IMAP idle for ""push"" emails and sync read, forward and answered mails plus sync send folder!"
guid	0	smth	Email for business is very impotant!
guid	0	smth	For all the guys & girls over the 45 years old, de need a really big clock in the main display.
guid	0	smth	Thanks (sorry about my english).
guid	0	smth	Positioning cursor is almost imposible
guid	1	smth	WP should support ussd menu and umb as well
guid	0	smth	Once removed the Metro interface looks good from a desktop app, but on the mobile phone is horrible.
guid	0	smth	When the volume is in the rang 01-09, the volume does not decrease.
guid	1	smth	Continuing my prior post about allowing us to explicitly flip secondary live tiles with a tap instead of launching the app, this request would allow such an action to explicitly update the tile by triggering a function call in a background task.
guid	1	smth	Perhaps these two ideas are combined and you define which action to take when creating/updating the tile... Flip the tile, execute a background task (or both), or simply launch the app like normal (possibly with deep toast.)
guid	0	smth	That would really make LiveTiles 'Live' which now, they kind of aren't and were by *far* the biggest disappointment when we saw the actual SDK.
guid	0	smth	Coming from iOS, when we did see that, we scrapped two apps we were going to release on WP7.
guid	0	smth	(A third was scrapped because of the inability to do location tracking in a background task more frequently than once every 30 minutes, which is sort of the same 'stale data' issue as here.)
guid	0	smth	Since it's user-initiated, it wouldn't drain_æ_ more
guid	1	smth	In the Schedule Namespace ist isn't possible to have access to the Media Library to play Songs, User has already on his Device -> Please add this function to get access to the Media Library.
guid	1	smth	Another thing is, to have the possibility to modify the Notification, wich is shown, when the Alarm or Reminder Rings.
guid	0	smth	We need to open our Application, or to overwrite the notify to costumize it to get a better improvement for the user.
guid	1	smth	Extend the API to query phone volume and vibration settings, maybe even set them.
guid	1	smth	Please provide validation templates for WindowsPhone controls.
guid	1	smth	However, not everybody has a physical device, so having those experiences in the emulator would be a great addition to the dev tools and resources.
guid	1	smth	Would be nice and useful to have email messages grouped by date, same as contacts grouped by initial letter.
guid	1	smth	For sharing audio and video there should be a very plain possibility to share stuff as already encoded package.
guid	1	smth	Perhaps that could be available as Toolkit in codeplex.com.
guid	1	smth	There needs to be an Alpha Test mechanism available.
guid	0	smth	Since the beta test versions I recently submitted have been waiting for certification for 9 days, there is no way for us to work together on this.
guid	0	smth	My boss is not a developer and has no development tools but absolutely needs to see the progress of development in a timely manner.
guid	0	smth	If the Beta program certified apps in a day then this might not be a problem.
guid	0	smth	As it is, it is hardly usable as a beta test program since our customers also need to see the app and improvements in a timely manner.
guid	0	smth	We need support special multitasking tasks, like VOIP and IM!
guid	0	smth	We can't create good apps for this services without this API, looks on your Skype client, wtf??
guid	0	smth	iOS already has this API's!
guid	0	smth	Volume on headphone, when phone rings while listening to a song, raise to max volume.
guid	0	smth	Multi-select on Zune to delete Albums or to create a playlist
guid	0	smth	Read/write accsess to email sync settings could enable applications to create custom sync profiles (based on week-days, time, position, etc).
guid	1	smth	Implement Soundwave touchless api on the phone for touch free Metro.
guid	0	smth	Microsoft boffins showed how they can use audio via the speaker and microphone and a dopplar computation to detect gestures without touching the screen.
guid	0	smth	I want to use that on the Phone for some games.
guid	1	smth	In the submission process, publishers should be able to check a box for apps that are made for individuals 13 or older and 18 or older.
guid	0	smth	This should flag a feature in the marketplace, when an app is being downloaded, to verify the age of the downloader.
guid	0	smth	In WP7 you can add multiple accounts of different types (Live, Google, Facebook, etc).
guid	1	smth	It would be nice to be allowed to get basic information about these accounts.
guid	0	smth	For example, get a list of all email accounts and for each account report the number of unread emails.
guid	0	smth	I think there are two ways to improve the beta program: 1.
guid	1	smth	Make apps available immediately.
guid	0	smth	"When developing on iOS (using testflight) or Android, we don't have to wait two hours for beta code to be ""approved""."
guid	0	smth	We upload a new version or have the users download an update immediately.
guid	1	smth	If immediate approval is not possible, then apps that have been published should be immediately available.
guid	0	smth	When we receive emails saying the beta application is published, users are not able to download the application with the very own links provided in the email.
guid	0	smth	Users are reporting a 1-2 day time between when the app is approved to when it is available for download.
guid	0	smth	Users receive a strange marketplace error when trying to download the application.
guid	0	smth	When developing apps it is often useful to leverage existing Launchers and Choosers as Tasks to access certain data or perform an operation.
guid	0	smth	Currently this is only exposed for system-level data and operations.
guid	1	smth	It would be ideal to allow apps to expose certain bits of data or functionality to other apps to provide a complementary experience in terms of reuse of information or performing similar tasks.
guid	0	smth	Imagine shopping apps being able to share a set of data such as a wish list or news apps being able to share a list of news feeds.
guid	0	smth	Imagine having an installed app do what it does best for another app, such as perform a series of complex calculations or gather weather data.
guid	0	smth	It would be the responsibility of the app to decide what it exposes for data or functionality.
guid	1	smth	This can first be alleviated as with other security screening by prompting the user to allow an app to access another app's tasking features.
guid	1	smth	In such case, you'd better make your videos carefully so that it can leave a good user experience to the potential clients.
guid	1	smth	If you convert video to FLV flash video, which features much smaller size than popular formats, your videos will be watched unhinderedly with quick loading.
guid	0	smth	select FLV as output format
guid	0	smth	If you are more requirements of your video, such as bit rate, encoder, etc, you are do these settings one by one in the pop-up Formats window.
guid	0	smth	 When everything is finished, you can click Start button to start the video to FLV conversion process.
guid	0	smth	You are allowed to preview the converting process in slideshow.
guid	0	smth	As 99% computer owners have installed flash plugin in web browser, so it's naturally that FLV or SWF flash videos are more acceptable than popular videos formats, such as MP4, AVI, MPEG or ect.
guid	0	smth	If you convert video to FLV flash video, which features much smaller size than_æ_ more
guid	1	smth	Allow the BackgroundAudioPlayer to play tracks from the MediaLibrary.
guid	1	smth	Or allow applications that implement the XNA MediaPlayer class to run in the background.
guid	1	smth	Please add the possibility to add your own spell check service, or provide the data if a system wide one existed.
guid	0	smth	When I want to build some tiles in my app, I have to use buttons that I give a custom style.
guid	0	smth	But this is ugly since everyone implements this in another way, resulting in odd alignments, bad text colours, etc.
guid	1	smth	We need a simple and standardized way to create simple tiles that function as buttons.
guid	0	smth	Beta testers test our apps for free.
guid	1	smth	It would be nice if when the app/game is published in the marketplace we could include a list of the testers that helped us so they can get the app from free instead of having to buy it.
guid	1	smth	Android,iOs and Blackberry are compatible with this API So why don't we
guid	1	smth	I would be a really nice gesture to have an option wich can put everything to the other side, so when left handed people scroll, they could also see the content.
guid	0	smth	Visual Studio 11 and new Expression Blend.
guid	1	smth	Merge products together.
guid	1	smth	Add 'open app in marketplace' in the app menu (rate & review, uninstall, pin to start)
guid	0	smth	It does not look professional when scrolling upward at the end of any page or downward at the top the content of the page regardless of material or application will be stretched down
guid	0	smth	It is part of the effect through the whole operating system and does not particularly belong to any application.
guid	0	smth	Sometime the stretched content of the page does not look professional.
guid	1	smth	We need UPD broadcast to search for our devices in the network.
guid	0	smth	When an exception is thrown and intercepted by the debugger, Edit and Continue permits to change your code right while debugging to make the code continue.
guid	1	smth	We can allow music that is not copyrighted to be accessible if that is a huge issue.
guid	1	smth	Link to sql is not efficient at all, could they include sql , sqlight or other library.
guid	1	smth	It s impossible to connect easily to ftp network, I suggest to include it in the future sdk.
guid	1	smth	We want an Office Hub that open Openoffice document.
guid	1	smth	Currently for dynamic data binding controlls like listbox  is recommended.
guid	1	smth	Why can't I change phone search and IE search to Google or another provider that actually work?
guid	1	smth	Fix Bing or fix the phone.
guid	0	smth	At best this is unclear, but should the user pan or zoom they lose the frame of reference for the place we're trying ot show them.
guid	0	smth	You can sometimes work around this behaviour by specifying a search for the place you're trying to indicate but this is dependent upon the search results.
guid	0	smth	If the search finds nothing you get no pin.
guid	0	smth	Or if the search finds something other than what you intended you can end up with a pin (or pins) far from where you want them.
guid	1	smth	If it were possible to tell the task to show a pin (or pins) at a specific point (or points) that that would allow for a better user experience.
guid	1	smth	Even if we could just specify a label for the pin that would be better than nothing.
guid	1	smth	"Add an option ""Private"" to lock photos, movies, songs, calendar appointments..."
guid	1	smth	An exit button should be there on all application software's.
guid	1	smth	Show used volume, so you can see how much MB of your inclusive volume is already used.
guid	1	smth	We could just upload a CSR and Microsoft provide a signed certificate via their own CA.
guid	1	smth	It would be nice if a choice between vibration and the sound is given for typing
guid	1	smth	Pin settings 'airplane mode' 'wifi' etc in the start screen
guid	1	smth	"Allowing for tester groups or ""profiles"" would allow for efficient test setup in the Marketplace, especially for multiple products, by allowing a group to be assigned to the app as it is entered in the Marketplace as a beta."
guid	1	smth	Additionally, it would be great to have additional support for Enterprise developers that target a specific set of clients as opposed to the public masses of the Marketplace.
guid	1	smth	"First, an Enterprise Developer account could be established with a cost of, say $499, which is high enough to deter hobbyists or smaller companies from enrolling, while at the same time providing additional benefits to larger ""enterprise-level"" corporations."
guid	1	smth	Ideally, a mini storefront or splash page for the company and product would help draw in clients.
guid	1	smth	"Allowing for tester groups or ""profiles"" would allow for efficient test setup in the Marketplace, especially_æ_ more"
guid	1	smth	If the app shows sensitive data when deativated, it would be good to be able to use a different image for fast app switching instead of a screenshot of the application
guid	1	smth	Daemon service should be turnable on and off per app basis, in the same way like periodic tasks.
guid	1	smth	Microsoft should advertise windows phone development APIs in Visual Studio
guid	1	smth	Please make it instead fire an event, which could be used to open an app's search bar or page.
guid	1	smth	At least support displaying static GIF image.
guid	1	smth	Back and forward buttons needed, not the capacitive back button.
guid	1	smth	Please consider to enable support for unsafe code in Silverlight and Xna apps.
guid	1	smth	Maximizing all current main apps would be better than having 1mil appd in the marketplace.
guid	1	smth	Create option to allow Periodic Agents to run even if app has not been opened for x days.
guid	0	smth	This gives my family up to four LIVE accounts.
guid	0	smth	On an Xbox, we can log in and play games no problem, yet a W7 phone allows for only one user.
guid	0	smth	I can't even log in to another account to check or edit it, let alone play games with it.
guid	0	smth	A certain rival brand of phones allows users to switch between their LIVE equivalent accounts with no problems whatsoever.
guid	1	smth	I bought my WP7 phone with gaming in mind, but there's more than one gamer in this house - please make it possible for several gamertags to be used on one device!
guid	1	smth	Keeping the message as draft when exiting would save me the hassle of having to type it again...
guid	1	smth	Can we have windows phone development using visualstudio lite IDE which includes only phone developement.
guid	1	smth	"Start by expanding the number of apps that can use a certain key word, such as ""childrens stories"" so that new apps who innovate can displace those who got their first with potentially crappy apps."
guid	1	smth	Secondly, you need to limit the number of apps that a publisher can submit with a particular key word.
guid	1	smth	We should have some way within our app to get notify that whether user selected call, don't call and when he/she ended call means notification of end call.
guid	1	smth	It would be more useful if specific Service apps could be released that would extend these features by, for example, adding a Google+ option to the sharing interface.
guid	1	smth	Would be nice if in power point, could have same method as in pictures hub for navigation.
guid	1	smth	Received from an MVP this week over email: It would be great to be able to have the emulator location data use the NMEA file format - either via file import/export, or using the files directly as a feed.
guid	1	smth	Other devices use this format and it would be great to see it supported by Windows Phone.
guid	1	smth	they all use Sip so it would be great to have a native sip client integrated.
guid	1	smth	Also a T9 keyboard would be nice too.
guid	1	smth	I want to be able to add a picture to the media library and then start the SharePictureTask to let the user see and share it from the Pictures Hub
guid	1	smth	Remove the 50 apps limit from the phone and 100 app limit from the marketplace web site when users search for an app with a search term.
guid	1	smth	add a quick access Block button/function to be used when receiving spam over chat
guid	1	smth	I would like to see a monthly/yearly subscription model introduced that let me charge users $5 a year for my app for example.
guid	1	smth	We really need Assembly Binding Redirection (or Publisher Policies) in Windows Phone!!
guid	1	smth	It would be great if you could add .png support to the medialibrary so that we can save high quality png files to the picture library.
guid	1	smth	Being able to use simple uncompressed .wav files would open up many possibilities for ring tone editors, and make files recorded from the microphone ready to be used as ringtones.
guid	1	smth	It would be great if the Windows Phone development team could allow us to use the RSTP streaming protocol in .NET Compact Framework we use.
guid	1	smth	Provide preference setting to categorize apps in the long list by their categories in app store rather than names or alphabetical order...this is extremely helpful for people with lots of apps and provide the ability to maintain the uniformity of the UI while making it more user friendly
guid	0	smth	This will provide more usability of the live tiles on the start menu..especially when one needs to drag multiple tiles through long list
guid	1	smth	Please get metequotes to make metatrader for Windows Phone.
guid	1	smth	Need of Logger Class to log error,Info,Verbose and daemon Information.
guid	0	smth	As it is available in android.It improves the debugging process.
guid	0	smth	It displays the certificate signer information, but you could easily upload two certificates with different CNs (service names) issued by a single CA and you would have no way of telling them apart.
guid	1	smth	Minimally it should show the CN from the subject which matches the service name you provide in client code, along with the CN of the signer.
guid	0	smth	Ideally it would allow you to download the certificate for verification or at least provide a md5 hash of the uploaded certificate.
guid	0	smth	Right now you can upload an unsupported certificate or even self-signed cert and apphub will not provide any feedback.
guid	1	smth	Allow the user to be able to set a custom reminder time such as 2 hours or 1.5 hours before the Calendar entry.
guid	0	smth	At present you only provide fixed values like 1hr or 18hr before!
guid	0	smth	tesco club card app shows you points and you have you clubcard bar code avaible on your phone to scan at checkout
guid	0	smth	apps has your nectar that you are able to scan in stores, also shows you your points balance, and allows you to shop online and collect more nectar points.
guid	1	smth	I would like a button I can click that will only select the countries for which Microsoft already accounts for any taxes.
guid	1	smth	Support file transfer such as PDF files
guid	1	smth	A bevy of restrictions can also be heaped on the said user control in order to maintain performance and not sap battery life.
guid	1	smth	Let Live tiles be live, please.
guid	1	smth	when an alarm pops up an option to edit the reminder should be included instead of having to constantly hit snooze or exit the reminder and go into the object itself
guid	1	smth	I need a posibility to set the keyboard language from code.
guid	0	smth	the focus on TextBox1 opens the keyboard with the german layout, the focus on TextBox2 opens the keyboard with a greek layout.
guid	0	smth	"on desktop under net 2.0/3.5 is this no problem: Windows Forms: InputLanguage.CurrentInputLanguage = InputLanguage.FromCulture(new System.Globalization.CultureInfo(""ar-EG"")) WPF: (This is exact what i need) InputLanguageManager.SetInputLanguage(textBox1, new System.Globalization.CultureInfo(""en-US"")); InputLanguageManager.SetRestoreInputLanguage(textBox1, true); I have tested this and it works fine."
guid	0	smth	If the keyboard is not installed, nothing changes and the current layout remain.
guid	0	smth	Please implement this, it is important for me for a translation application.
guid	1	smth	I suggest to create hardware ratings, like ones in Winows 7 (WEI), for the smartphone in order to help both users and developers to match hardware with apps or games.
guid	0	smth	I think that this ratings will even enable developers to create different versions of the same app pointing to specific hardware.
guid	1	smth	It would be nice to be able to use the computer keyboard when using the emulator.
guid	0	smth	It's a bit frustrating to type with the mouse.
guid	0	smth	"we can't use some important libraries in the background agent like ""Microsoft.devices.sensors"" that limite our power to creat a good application"
guid	1	smth	currently you can only pin an album, but it would be useful if you can pin a single image as a tile.. that way you have easy access to a it.
guid	0	smth	school schedule, bus route, or a picture of someone you like...
guid	0	smth	The current AdControl crashes any app which uses the silverlight/XNA hybrid mode.
guid	0	smth	Apparently this has never worked nor communicated to Devs!
guid	0	smth	"I normally wouldn't say ""This is unexceptable"" but given that silverlight/xna hybrid is the new big thing for WP7, this issue needs immediate attention."
guid	0	smth	...which is useful if you want to add an appointment with the same time/location/notes as a previous one.
guid	0	smth	Currently when you press and hold an appointment in the calendar, you have the option to Edit or Delete.
guid	0	smth	You either have re-enter all the info, or change the date of the old appointment (but that's not ideal because you lose record of old appointments)
guid	1	smth	local scout should show more than just 20 results, there should be the ability to state the radius from current location and all businesses within that radius should be shown, which could greatly exceed 20. also, if searching a company name for a small business/restaurant, it would be good if that could show within local results.
guid	0	smth	often i try to search for a restaurant and there is no result under local, instead i have to find their website and then their postcode.
guid	0	smth	this would save me that hastle, and make planning journeys much simpler.
guid	1	smth	Allow an app to disable text messaging preview.
guid	1	smth	Allow users to link their app with the 'me' and 'people' hub directly.
guid	1	smth	Now that we have API access to contact information it would be useful to immediately be able to click on a contact and open it in a related app, e.g.
guid	0	smth	Skype, twitter, etc.
guid	1	smth	Add a full support of RegionInfo and add possibility to instanciate one with two letter iso code.
guid	0	smth	SO, we can use it to dispal country name with user language.
guid	1	smth	Add option to hide keyboard: specially when you want to copy a long text.. the keyboard takes around 60% of your LCD space, leaving you with a tiny window to work with.
guid	0	smth	Exactly As The Title Says.
guid	1	smth	can you please create a tesco clubcard app
guid	1	smth	Allow the ability to view SSL Certificates on HTTPS Connections in IE and have the option to install the CA.
guid	1	smth	I suggests to add some kind of Storage to store GPS POI.
guid	1	smth	In addition this storage may have integration with contacts to allow user have geographical map of his contacts.
guid	1	smth	port Internet Explorer 10 to a mobile version (as soon as ie10 is ready) to get all new ie10 features to our mobile phones so we can build better webapps for windows phone.
guid	1	smth	pls support fixed possitioned elements!!
guid	1	smth	I'd like to have tiles of various colours on my start screen.
guid	1	smth	Allow access to raw data such as signal strength imformation to allow creation of indoor location positioning using available wifi, bluetooth or cellular networks when no gps data is available.
guid	1	smth	It would be nice if there were an app that logged things that happen on your phone: ie.
guid	1	smth	 it would be also great if there were an icon in the status bar that indicates that that are new events/notifications..
guid	1	smth	I'd like the ability for an application to be quick loaded from the right-hand corder of the lock keypad.
guid	1	smth	If that's not possible, allow a button to be overriden and pressed during the locked screen process.
guid	1	smth	Also, I want to be able to set the % left of power for when the batterysaver kicks in.
guid	1	smth	The default setting is way too late--I'd prefer 50% or more remaining before turning on.
guid	1	smth	It'd be very convenient for developers without actual devices to test their apps for the certification requirements if everything could actually be tested with the emulator.
guid	1	smth	Please upgrade the YouTube App by Microsoft Corp. with Metro UI instead directing to a mobile site.
guid	1	smth	Expose the SongCollection class so we can add and remove song objects from custome song collections.
guid	1	smth	Allow the BackgorundAudioAgent to utilise the XNA framework so that the device's song library can be played and manipulated from the background.
guid	1	smth	You would also need to provide a conversion mechanism to convert a Song to an AudioTrack - as is the default file type for the BAP.
guid	1	smth	Relax the restrictions around application running under a locked screen and/or in the background.
guid	0	smth	Unless of course we go with a predetermined SongCollection such as SongCollection limitedPlaylist =_æ_ more
guid	1	smth	We need the ability to build apps that are capable of video editing for WP!
guid	1	smth	Please DevGroup make this APIs should enable developers to build apps that include the ability to do video trimming, editing, and saving to the video library.
guid	0	smth	This is needed to build VoIP application.
guid	0	smth	Playing audio stream in loudspeaker is uncomfortable for users.
guid	0	smth	sir, i have samsung omnia w. its running latest update.
guid	0	smth	when i charged my phone, then the key press becomes laggy and hard
guid	1	smth	Allow applications to define custom shaders in HLSL.
guid	0	smth	This will allow sophisticated game graphics and real-time image processing.
guid	1	smth	Also allow access to MP4 encoder library (hardware accelerated) so apps can generate their own videos.
guid	0	smth	This should also allow apps to read existing videos, modify frames and write them back.
guid	0	smth	for gps tracking apps
guid	0	smth	There is an Android app which displays all local wifi connections, with their channel number, strength and, of course, name.
guid	0	smth	WPF7 should have one like this too!
guid	0	smth	Currently, I can detect and control what the embedded Zune player is currently playing.
guid	0	smth	The same can't be done with 3rd party apps implementing background audio streaming like soundtracker etc.
guid	0	smth	Hello, thank you for this site.
guid	0	smth	I was very happy to be able to scan barcodes from the search button and I would like to use this in my application.
guid	1	smth	The design guidelines should be the law.
guid	1	smth	Don't allow ugly interfaces, be stricter on things like navigation, general look and feel, even animation.
guid	1	smth	Give developers good explanation what they do wrong, and enforce good design.
guid	1	smth	If something is unresponsive, it should not be allowed unless there is a clear and good reason for it.
guid	1	smth	Apps should take no longer than 2-3 seconds to start, and need to explain why they would take longer.
guid	1	smth	Make the marketplace of the highest quality out there!
guid	1	smth	"Support for WEBGL like the rest of the world - Microsoft have done this too many times - we as MS developers are starting to look stupid 5 years behind on the mobile market - Ballmer ""iPad's are just under powered PC's"", Gates ""the internet is just a fad"" enough admit you are wrong early rather than late it's much easier that way."
guid	0	smth	The biggest problem I almost exclusively run into when working on WP7 apps is the layout performance of Silverlight.
guid	0	smth	It's takes quite some effort to work around that problem.
guid	0	smth	And according to web searches about this problem I felt that I'm not a lone with this.
guid	0	smth	It'd be great if you would work on a solution to improve the situation.
guid	1	smth	too often we come across a word in an app we might not know or we just want to confirm the meaning of it we colud look it up right where u r without the need to exit n go in to another app.
guid	1	smth	with this mod we can enjoy the platform more the than ever before is to make in the landscape like the upcoming windows 8 or like the original tile home screen from up to down or down to up
guid	1	smth	An address bar should be added to Calendar items to give the location of your appointment/meeting.
guid	1	smth	This address should be visible on the Bing maps showing you the location of your calendar item.
guid	1	smth	Vice versa, you should be able to schedule via the Bing maps, adding a location on the maps and linking it to the Calendar.
guid	1	smth	Return back a multi-task support (may be optional?) will significal improve advanced users experience.
guid	0	smth	In current situation its almost impossible to create some kind of applications, such as different trackers, survilence etc
guid	1	smth	A color picker control just like the one in the phone's settings would be really useful for apps which want to offer the user a choice of colors.
guid	0	smth	I know I can code one, but it should be one of the standard controls.
guid	0	smth	The current IE mobile browser doesn't support keyup correctly.
guid	0	smth	I'd like to show Youtube videos in my app.
guid	1	smth	I would like to have control over the size, positioning and playback of a video.
guid	1	smth	there should be an option to change the working of these buttons to double click, so that a slight
guid	1	smth	Allow for video camera control, start and stop recording from the touch screen instead of just the camera button.
guid	1	smth	A demo or prototype category like it exists on Android would solve this issue.
guid	1	smth	As of now the number of contacts that can be added to a group is restricted to 20, please remove the cap.
guid	0	smth	Already music streaming is supported but only for single songs.
guid	1	smth	would't it be great to add albums to SkyDrive and stream them directly from there.
guid	1	smth	Prefferably the albums would be integrated in the music & videos hub similarly to jow SkyDrive pictures are integrated in pictures hub
guid	1	smth	All notifications should exist in a pull down shade in iOS/Android style.
guid	1	smth	The pull down shade should take on the color theme you have choosen for your phone.
guid	1	smth	Notifications should exist within the shade as black tiles and will illustrate the notification type and a short phrase from the email, sms text, facebook/twitter mention, etc.
guid	1	smth	have a background agent enable all the time to execute an application event not execute them periodically
guid	0	smth	Ability to add a custom buttons to system call app, like in screenshots http://bit.ly/incomingScreen http://bit.ly/incallScreen click on button will launch some callback which will access to: 1.
guid	0	smth	Access to call voice stream in/out 2.
guid	0	smth	Access to call controls, can initiate a new call, end exists, etc, all features provided by standard buttons on call page
guid	0	smth	currenty when you hit the Back button from the Folders (in the Mail app), it takes you back to Homescreen.
guid	0	smth	Please fix this so that it goes back to Inbox (and not exit the app!)
guid	1	smth	in addition to the current Alphabetical view, add Sorting options like: Sort by last installed, Sort by recently accessed.. Also it would be nice to have a shortcut screen like the fullscreen blue alphabet tiles, but with dates: 1 day ago, 1 week ago, 2 weeks ago...
guid	0	smth	Doing something like the actual WebBrowserTask, but with Uri pointing to file in IsolatedStorage
guid	1	smth	Add a method to run another app passing params.
guid	1	smth	there should be a function to costumise the tile depending on mood
guid	0	smth	if the homescreen's tile automaticaly arranged in recent , most used, favart, and latest updated.
guid	0	smth	then it would be better
guid	1	smth	Let us buy internet, free sms or minutes in our career codes.
guid	1	smth	Let us call codes *...# I think it's one of the most important things here.
guid	1	smth	Support for word wrap or something would let us give more meaningful titles to our apps, with less app title duplications.
guid	1	smth	The ability to broadcast and bind sockets to a port would be handy for making local client <=> server applications where you don't need to specify the server IP.
guid	1	smth	We want a clean and simple interface which WORKS.
guid	0	smth	I, for example, wrote four applications in about two days.
guid	0	smth	Getting them all published took me over three months.
guid	0	smth	It's just not right.
guid	0	smth	The process (particularly for someone under the age of 18) of getting a Dreamspark account (particularly now that you've messed up that website) and an App Hub account is absolutely awful._æ_ more
guid	0	smth	windows phone dev is powerless without low level api to access drivers or add features to phone
guid	0	smth	I have developed an app which plays audio using the BackgroundAudioPlayer.
guid	0	smth	If I am listening to audio over Bluetooth and I pause the audio, if the Bluetooth device disconnects, the audio resumes playing.
guid	0	smth	I run continous background processing in my app (frequency analysis of the mic, if anyone cares).
guid	1	smth	I'd like to control the priority of this background thread to make the user experience better.
guid	1	smth	We note that microsoft bought Skype, so we need an app that includes Facebook chat, Skype chat, video call and normal calling.
guid	0	smth	Enterprise feature
guid	0	smth	calendar functionality does not allow for specifying end date for meeting or appointment.
guid	1	smth	Bring back reccurrence from wm 6.5 where you could create complex meeting schedules
guid	0	smth	Then i can write an App to simulate a Keyboard or a mouse and don't need software on PC.
guid	1	smth	In SDK give an UI explorer view for Isolated Storage to download, upload isolated storage files from device to desktop.
guid	0	smth	This will help in testing out and debugging applications which use Isolated storage significantly.
guid	0	smth	it is not possible to send an email with an attachement, i.e.
guid	0	smth	when applying for a job.
guid	0	smth	A faster way to switch between vibration on and off than having to open settings, ringtones+sounds.
guid	1	smth	It would be nice with a switcher on the volume control like the button ring/silent.
guid	1	smth	Android gives you the capability to zee how much storage a particular app uses, we could really do with this. 
guid	0	smth	when ever i make a call my phone's screen goes dark even if im not puting it on my ears.
guid	0	smth	Ive read alot of concerns regarding this problem.
guid	0	smth	why shouldn't I as user be able to see reviews made by people from other countries??
guid	0	smth	Here in Denmark there aren't that many wp users yet, so a lot of apps will show up in the marketplace without any reviews, -even though you can see in apptracker that there exist some reviews...
guid	0	smth	to sell phones with qwerty sliding like HTC 7 Pro Arrive while OS is not providing landscape for all apps is something between ridicolous and unfair.
guid	0	smth	When you enter a wrong word in the keyboard dictionary (e.g .while typing in word) 
guid	0	smth	the only way to remove it is to clear the full dictionary (by using keyboard / typing settings/ reset suggestions) 
guid	1	smth	We need a way to select the word(s) we want to delete
guid	0	smth	Control to send desired picture to native pinch to zoom controller.
guid	0	smth	One line of code to enable native picture viewer with pinch-to-zoom.
guid	1	smth	Instead of having to tap the screen you should have the choice of locking it at the top of the screen.
guid	1	smth	Tuenti is a social network as Facebook (in Spanish or English or Catalan), it would be very useful for spanish people or south americans or people who have signed up on it, to have it (integrated) into the people hub.
guid	0	smth	I have a lot spanish friends who have hesitated to buy a Windows phone (and finally didn't buy it) because their favourite social network wasn't neither on the marketplace, neither on the people hub
guid	1	smth	android has the pull down notification area well we should have a live tile where all notifications come in so if ur using an app n its not pin to ur start screen u can still know when u have a notification.
guid	0	smth	possibility of viewer and writter .rar files, and native support .rar would good job
guid	1	smth	The built-in support for some DPWS devices would be nice, especially printing to WSD printers (or capturing images from WSD scanners) would be a significant feature.
guid	1	smth	Implementing such protocol is not impossible and printing from applications would be welcome not only by developers but by end users as well - once available in Office applications etc.
guid	1	smth	If phone is lost allow remotely setting custom message on the lock screen, i.e. contact information.
guid	0	smth	As for now the PictureDecoder can only decode JPG and run on the UI thread.
guid	1	smth	I am especially thinking about tile generation on background agents : I'd like to have an enriched PictureDecoder able to run on any thread and decode PNG as well.
guid	0	smth	extended ability to highlight text or links within apps such as Facebook and Twitter for copy paste, individual text/word highlight of a text bubble with the WP7 txts.
guid	0	smth	improoved text edit cursor positioning, when highlighting text close to the top of the screeb or too far down, the scrolling plays up anf makes it awkward to get it right.
guid	0	smth	wifi data transfer wp7 to wp7
guid	0	smth	The ability for applications to follow the data connection of the device (especially Edge/3G etc.)
guid	0	smth	if they run as background tasks with live tiles, as most carriers provide limited amount of connection
guid	0	smth	We can able to call Managed code functionality in silver light 3.
guid	0	smth	But in windows Phone for silverlight dosnt provide the dll System Windows Browser. 
guid	0	smth	Better Multitasking with the ability to have background applications on.
guid	0	smth	Example I am playing a game and i pause and want to play later.
guid	0	smth	Then i want to use my phone as usual, go in to other apps and that kind of stuff.
guid	0	smth	Then later when i want to continue playing from where I paused I hold the back button and i see that game is open in the background, not only the 6 latest apps.
guid	1	smth	It would be really cool if developers could get api access to Xbox Live Gamertags, that way they don't have to make users create a new account just to play multiplayer games.
guid	0	smth	It would also help a lot for leaderboards too.
guid	0	smth	If you look at all of the most popular programs in any field (Photoshop, Office, Chrome, etc..) one thing is always constant and that is 3rd party extensability.
guid	0	smth	Bring this to Windows phone to all native apps.
guid	1	smth	Instead of making a new camera app, allow me to extend the native one.
guid	0	smth	Bring this to all of the native apps including office, the dialer, people hub, etc...
guid	0	smth	TAB is usefull to jump from textbox to another e.g.
guid	0	smth	in the registration forms using only the keyboard.
guid	0	smth	Arrows keys to move easly throught the text!
guid	0	smth	When you have more than 5 Groups you need to scroll down in case you want to find a single Contact.
guid	0	smth	The [A-Z]-Button should open the Letter-grid to jump to the desired point in the list.
guid	0	smth	i would like it to work just like the walgreens app
guid	1	smth	The mango way to switch between tab is slow as .... so please implement a quicker way to do that or roll back to the previous IE's chrome.
guid	0	smth	greater permission to manage the music.
guid	1	smth	"help define the current position of the current music with the mediaplayer Zune ""seek position""."
guid	0	smth	"to obtain another possibilities to move in the music as the default button ""fast forward""."
guid	0	smth	In a windows desktop, ALT+TAB is used to switch quickly between apps.
guid	0	smth	We need something just as fast in WP7.
guid	1	smth	One suggestion is: Double tap home icon quickly, to see the list of open apps - as shown currently.
guid	0	smth	This is faster than holding down the Back key for some time.
guid	1	smth	zune payer should support custome codec plugin so one can play any format.
guid	1	smth	Please expand the MessageBoxButton option in Silverlight to include a Yes/No or Yes/No/Cancel option.
guid	1	smth	It would be nice to have a modal control that is standard between applications with additional user choices available.
guid	1	smth	the mutitasking area should have every app that you have opened in it.
guid	1	smth	The last five should be frozen and any more than that should have to restarted.
guid	1	smth	To close an app the user should be able to use her/his finger to flick it upwards WebOS style.
guid	1	smth	In addition, the user should be able to take a screenshot within the multitasking area by using a finger gesture to drag the app towarda the bottom of the screen, a screen capture icon should appear and the outer edges of the icon should fill with green and onve the edges are_æ_ more
guid	1	smth	It will be very useful if you can asign a static IP
guid	0	smth	IPv6 begins to be widely supported.
guid	0	smth	It was available in WM6.5 (and older) so it would be great to see this included in WP7 (and later)
guid	1	smth	allow sync of ms exchange notes
guid	1	smth	"because push notifications can easily go unnoticeable, there should be a history in the ""me"" tile that will also tell you if you missed something."
guid	0	smth	Tile counts are nice but I dont have every app pinned nor do I want it that way.
guid	0	smth	Just a history for one days notifications would be enough.
guid	1	smth	"It would be really nice to have a ""Share"" task that I could pass a stream to, in order to share an image."
guid	0	smth	This task could bring up the same interface when I share an photo from my pictures library.
guid	0	smth	It would make it simple to share photos to facebook and twitter if the user already has it setup.
guid	0	smth	It would also make it possible to finally share photos via sms and email programmatically.
guid	0	smth	Examples: Google should be able to add Google+ support to me, people hubs.
guid	0	smth	Amazon should be able to integrate their cloud music seamlessly with music+video hub.
guid	0	smth	Flickr should be able to integrate with picture hub.
guid	1	smth	When searching in the market you should be able to open the app if already installed.
guid	1	smth	Please provide APIs for call forwarding and other call management functions(hold/unhold,swap,conference,etc)
guid	1	smth	As a user, I would like to be able to select songs that I have put on the device (from my library) to wake up to.
guid	0	smth	As a developer, I can only allow the user to choose from songs that I included with the app.
guid	0	smth	The main work-around I've seen in the various alarm clock apps is to force the user to keep the app open over night which is not particularly awesome for battery life.
guid	1	smth	Add an option to customize the size of Pictures uploaded to Skydrive or send via mail.
guid	1	smth	Also add an option to autoupload full images tu Skydrive and not only 718x538 px as preset on the lumia 800.
guid	0	smth	"Right now, you can start apps by holding down the Windows button and saying ""start appname""."
guid	1	smth	"It would be great if you could start an app while adding some instructions, for example: ""Facebook, show me messages"" ""Office, create new Word document"" ""Prime TV, mark House Season 1 Episode 4 as watched"""
guid	0	smth	when holding my phone in one hand, the palm of my hand just below my thumb come very close to the search button and a stretch to far can often send me off to the search function while i am texting or writing an email.
guid	0	smth	is there any possibilty that these 3 controls can somehow be made less sensitive or become a more mechanical click?
guid	0	smth	The touchmove event is called only once, when I move my finger across the screen.
guid	0	smth	So I can't create complex HTML pages with a fixed header and a scrollable content.
guid	0	smth	I will move the content per javascript but I can not because the touchmove event is not triggered.
guid	1	smth	Please implement the whole TouchApi in the Internet Explorer and the WebBrowser Control.
guid	0	smth	This is VERY IMPORTANT for mobile websites because iPhone and Android support this.
guid	0	smth	Emails are non editable while
guid	0	smth	Enable picture password as in Windows 8.
guid	0	smth	deleting multiple for sms as email services
guid	0	smth	"I am thinking about a SDK to allow me to create an ""account app""."
guid	1	smth	So like google, facebook, linkedin I want to create contacts, calendar and access to message hub (also writing messages with my account).
guid	1	smth	Marketplace upload of this kind should be more restricted to avoid problems.
guid	0	smth	When I'm reading a web page or other document, I would find it incredibly useful to be able to jump to the jump of the document without endless swiping.
guid	0	smth	if more elements one day.
guid	0	smth	We cant see the other:(
guid	0	smth	it is slightly fustrating when one or two screenshots take longer to load and you cannot skip them while swiping through the images.
guid	0	smth	Like windows mobile 6.5 and older version.
guid	0	smth	Currently, you can only have the review page from the app list with the contextual menu.
guid	1	smth	It will be pleasant to go the main page of the app in the marketplace to see the general pr©sentation, screenshots & the other users reviews
guid	1	smth	add capability to enter manual parametets for visual voicemail
guid	0	smth	currently in the all applications view tge jumplist appears only when there are more than 40 apps.
guid	1	smth	i have about 30 apps and it is already difficult to find an app ...i think the jumplist shuld be always available.
guid	0	smth	I believe scrolling should be improved.
guid	0	smth	As sometimes when users are viewing a long document, they sometimes might want to skip to the middle/lower section.
guid	0	smth	But scrolling seems to take a little long..
guid	0	smth	Thus, this idea is actually for the developers to make scrolling faster after each subsequent scroll, like every 5 scrolls the scrolling speed will increase..
guid	1	smth	ensure that we can buy clips, movies and videos directly to WP7 without necessarily going through a PC
guid	0	smth	Swipe from the top down with two fingers and flick through the last closed app as seen in Windows 8.
guid	0	smth	For instance, email and messaging notifications could be silenced at night, whilst call ringtones would function as normal.
guid	0	smth	by benchmarking a developer a good developer work.
guid	0	smth	it will encourage a developer to design better apps and it makes very easy for customers to choose the right apps ibstead of selectibg some poorly designed apps and wasting the time..
guid	1	smth	I see many developers can be benefited from text2speech api.
guid	0	smth	It can also bring in whole range of new apps for windows phone.
guid	0	smth	In Android For C2DM , Google is providing free account and restrict number of messages per day.
guid	1	smth	Supporting Windows Authentication could be very usefull for example writing app that interacts with Microsoft Dynamics CRM
guid	0	smth	currently only a defined set of extensions are supported for files to upload to SkyDrive using the new live API which limit really the usage of the API.
guid	0	smth	For example my app can export .CSV files and I had to rename their extensions to .TXT to be able to upload them to SkyDrive using the live API.
guid	1	smth	The language should be a search critreria for apps and games.
guid	0	smth	The non-english marketplaces are filled with apps that support only english and it is hard to find apps in my native language.
guid	1	smth	If it's MS Windows Phone then make it as a part of the network.
guid	0	smth	Will see all shared resources.
guid	0	smth	One shared folder can be set on phone device.
guid	0	smth	Easy to access and transfer on both sides PC-Phone.
guid	1	smth	A business feature that would be really nice to have support for it the ability to tie into a VoIP network for voip phone calls... the most common architecture is the SIP (Session Initiation Protocol).
guid	1	smth	So I would like the ability to configure a SIP client that ties into our VoIP PBX and phone system.. so my WP7 would basically become my desk phone (extension).
guid	0	smth	The only way this would really work well is if it ran in the background like the phone's native phone functionality.
guid	1	smth	If there is an app developer the a customer lukes i'd be good to see everything that they have made.
guid	0	smth	Full (or almost) Entity Framework support, including graphic class designer and interop with regular EF assemblies, making it easy for developers to reuse model and persistence classes in the phone, without the need to redo all the work in Linq and some nasty tricks.
guid	1	smth	It would be nice to have the Deployment ability on my home PC able to be done wirelessly.
guid	0	smth	This includes deploying in Visual Studio while developing, and using the Application Deployment Tool that is installed w/ the dev tools.
guid	0	smth	For me, the benefit would be that when I don't have a microUSB cable handy, I can still dev and deploy to my phone to try something out, or deploy my friend's XAP to my phone w/o having to go find a cable first.
guid	0	smth	This could be implemented via WiFi, of course (since Zune does wireless Sync already), or even Bluetooth once we get Bluetooth data transfer ability.
guid	0	smth	Wp7.5 lacks USB audio functionality with Microsoft Sync in cars.
guid	0	smth	Bluetooth playing audio is very limited.
guid	1	smth	Requesting MTP and mass storage functionality since competitors like iPhone are able to do all this already with Sync.
guid	0	smth	In IsolatedStorage ,image file can save to local MediaLibrary,why not record wave file can not?
guid	0	smth	too slow and too little possibilities
guid	0	smth	I took a while until I realized that I forgot {StaticResource} within the Style attribute...
guid	0	smth	It's very hard to create application supporting multiple languages.
guid	1	smth	Give functionalities like Resource manager, as given by IDE of other platforms.
guid	1	smth	Managing resources and folder structure for them should be made easier.
guid	1	smth	make an EQ for the mp3 player...at the moment the volume it's really low
guid	0	smth	Curently 20 persons max.
guid	1	smth	"Please enable pinning of the ""Wi-Fi"" settings on Start page."
guid	1	smth	SplashScreenImageLight and SplashScreenImageDark would be great!
guid	1	smth	After that, it would be great to have the option to select an image from IsolatedStorage so that my app can update its splash screen image as needed.
guid	1	smth	Make it so that a meteo style app would only need to adapt its UI to run on Windows phone.
guid	1	smth	It would also be nice to have to deploy only one package to the marketplace but only the needed bits would be tranfered.
guid	1	smth	Add movies and books would be an excellent addition for the system !
guid	1	smth	"Enable Speech Command to play songs selection by saying ""play song name"", ""play artist"", ""play album""."
guid	1	smth	I believe the single most important thing for Windows Phone to be successful is that users in all countries should have the same services available.
guid	1	smth	Now when the marketplace has become available it would be great if users in other countries than US could migrate their accounts to the country they really live in.
guid	1	smth	Since windows phones are selling hot in countries like India, browser should start displaying Indian language characters.
guid	1	smth	Allow user to set different accent colors for different tiles.
guid	1	smth	we should have small tiles instead of a long list of apps of which you downloaded, like android and ios.
guid	1	smth	An app should be able to publish a service that is disvoerable and consumable by other apps.
guid	1	smth	For example, if I have an app that can process images, I want other apps to be able to dicover my app and submit photos for me to process.
guid	1	smth	I would like access to a stream for music played via the media library.
guid	1	smth	i wish the functionality to access and synchronize the public folder from exchange, e.g. the public contacts or the calendar.
