guid	0	smth	Wich means the new version not fully replaced the old version and this causes me very serious problems: 1.
guid	0	smth	Some of my users will still receive the old xap version of my app.
guid	0	smth	The store randomly gives the old xap or the new xap version of my app.
guid	0	smth	My app has a WP7 version and a WP8 version XAP in the same submission.
guid	0	smth	The wp7 xap works only on WP7 and the wp8 xap works only for WP8.
guid	0	smth	Sometimes the Store gives the wrong wp7 xap version of my app to Windows Phone 8 users.
guid	1	smth	"It should be an option to remove the ""ru"" language code from my app 'language History' or an option to completly replace: Fully replace the prevoius(es) xap(s)."

guid	0	smth	): the store will randomly deliver the old/wrong version of your xap.
guid	0	smth	I write a lot support ticket on this, but no one really cares on this issue.
guid	1	smth	"Provide a workaround for removing the ""ru"" language from the language history (I have no need for ""ru"" culture just for ""ru-ru"", but there is no way to remove ""ru"" from the language history if you ever posted your app with ""ru"" language support) 2."

guid	0	smth	When I driving my car and need to make call at 99% of times the phone use vocal commands for starting bing search instead of call contact.
guid	0	smth	"But if I press power button and unlock device and open phone and say ""call <person name, device start calling correctly!"
guid	0	smth	This in driving mode activated.
guid	0	smth	"Also in italian translation, after reading sms, the device say ""fatto"" for ending operation but work only if I say ""ho finito""."
guid	0	smth	"If I say ""fatto"" vocal command unrecognized!"
guid	0	smth	Other little bugs: with my lumia 820 before first WP8 upgrade work fine with vocal commands but from first upgrade to now is bad.
guid	0	smth	Don't recognize commands.
guid	0	smth	But my old wp7 work fine using same bt sony car stereo!
guid	0	smth	Other little bugs: with my lumia 820 before first WP8 upgrade work fine with vocal commands but from___ more

guid	0	smth	Open the network + settings and tap on call settings.
guid	0	smth	Hit the power button to go to sleep mode.
guid	0	smth	Wait for 15-20 minutes and switch on the mobile again.
guid	0	smth	The window will be blank with only heading on it.
guid	0	smth	100% reproducible on Lumia 920 cyan update.
guid	1	smth	I always use this feature, please fix ASAP.
guid	0	smth	Seems there is an issue with the sd card in WP 8.1 Preview.
guid	1	smth	Its getting annoying.Please fix this.
guid	0	smth	I've been working on an LOB for my field of engineering (civil/structural).
guid	0	smth	The point is to make the app universal across devices so that our engineers do not have to spend too much time learning and relearning the controls.
guid	0	smth	And because the same app runs on tablets and PC's, our engineers can work in the field, come back to their office, and continue working with the same data on their PC's.
guid	0	smth	Because of windows 8.1 and windows phone 8.1 universal app, I am hoping to adapt the app to windows phone as well.
guid	0	smth	But I've found that windows phone 8.1 file picker does not have access to onedrive and there is no futureaccesslist.
guid	0	smth	This aspect alone prevents any adaptation of my app to the windows phone platform.
guid	1	smth	Please allow windows phone 8.1 file/folder picker to have access to onedrive and store the location in futureaccesslist.
guid	1	smth	Also, please allow onedrive folder to be stored locally like winrt.
guid	0	smth	Otherwise, it's not a real universal app.
guid	0	smth	All the saved and live data are___ more
guid	0	smth	So far i have tried three different apps and I cannot access my pre windows phone 8.1 photos.
guid	1	smth	This needs fixing as a number 1 priority.
guid	1	smth	It would be nice to give developers the option put a payment on hold when they reach the appropriate threshold and have the option to put it on top of the next due payment when they reach the threshold after that.
guid	0	smth	in wp8.1 dev preview theres a bug with the push service.
guid	0	smth	when i__m on mobile data connection, i get all my notifications, when i__m on wifi there is no connection to the push server.
guid	0	smth	no i found a workaround for myself, when i turn off the mobile data connection manually the push over wifi works.
guid	0	smth	but on wp 8.0 gdr 3, the system recognized automaticly wich connection i__m using and turn the push service automaticly on cellular or on wifi.
guid	0	smth	everytime it works, with wp 8.1 dev preview it doesn__t.
guid	0	smth	When I try to insert a new Bank Account I receive an error because there is a validation that the Bank Account should be in the same Country of my account.
guid	0	smth	I think this is not correct, because using Paypal I can receive money in another country but I don't want pay extra costs for Paypal and also i can insert my tax plan in a country different of my country in my account.
guid	1	smth	Please remove that validation or validate according with my tax plan and not my country in the account.
guid	0	smth	: there is another post that I voted because I can't change the country in my account.
guid	0	smth	I did a report on in app purchases today and noticed that every line item shows an app version of 1.0.0 - which most certainly is not the case.
guid	0	smth	Make Bing Vision lens in the camera app pinnable to Start for quick access again and/or add it to the Cortana screen, to the left of the Music Search button perhaps.
guid	0	smth	In Windows Phone 8 we were able directly access facebook through the people hub.
guid	0	smth	Comment on photos, write on walls without having to enter the facebook app.
guid	0	smth	We were also able to switch between text messages and Facebook messages on the fly.
guid	0	smth	Now with WIndows Phone 8.1 the app ALWAYS has to open.
guid	0	smth	On my Lumia 920 it takes significantly longer to do that now.
guid	0	smth	IT'S SLOW!!!!
guid	1	smth	Please bring back the simplicity and efficiency of Windows Phone!
guid	1	smth	While I was building a web application, I've noticed that single page applications with this url: http://www.contoso.com/!#/ will display blank page and only a refresh will load the page again can you please check that?
guid	1	smth	It would be great if you would add a RemoteId to the calendars.
guid	0	smth	appointments have a RemoteId but calendars don't.
guid	0	smth	It would be easier to sync calendars if they have a RemoteId like appointments.
guid	0	smth	When the application is unpublished by Microsoft, the reason in sent by email.
guid	0	smth	When the email is not received (like in my case) the developer doesn't know the reason.
guid	0	smth	However this can be easily fixed by writing it in Dev Center.
guid	0	smth	In WinRT, the TileBrush class is missing the TileMode and View* properties that are present in other frameworks like WPF and Silverlight.
guid	1	smth	Please add these properties so that we can support image tiling properly.
guid	0	smth	There are tons of requests for this over the past years.
guid	0	smth	See this thread for an example: http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/windowsapps/en-US/bb5aa859-e3d1-46f2-a661-d4bdbee9a1f2/windowsuixamlmediaimagebrush?forum=winappswithcsharp
guid	1	smth	The Lockscreen text attribute should be separated out from Tile attributes.
guid	0	smth	To provide lockscreen text its necessary to use the WideBackContent attribute on the Flip tile.
guid	0	smth	But - if you have generated a custom tile and/or you don't want the tile to flip, then you cannot use the lockscreen text feature.
guid	0	smth	I'm trying to use the API for Contacts in the namespace Windows.ApplicationModel.Contacts, but it doesn't work as expected.
guid	0	smth	First of all, on Windows Phone 8.1 I always get an IOException when trying to call PickContactAsync().
guid	0	smth	This is very strange, since I was expecting to see at least Contacts app to be launched, seems there's some problem establishing the contract.
guid	0	smth	I also checked the Contacts permission was enabled on the Package.appxmanifest.
guid	0	smth	On Windows 8.1 / RT 8.1 che call to the PickContactAsync() works but I receive wrong data instaed, for example: FirstName and LastName are both in FirstName (and LastName is empty), the ImportantDates (e.g.
guid	0	smth	Birthday) are always set to low values (like 05/05/0004), but if I try to navigate the contacts through Outlook.com or Contacts/People app I can see the right values.
guid	0	smth	Maybe I'm missing something, but this API seems to be broken.

guid	0	smth	Although it is possible to define custom ETW events, and to generate those events, the publicly available tooling does not currently provide a way to get access to these events.
guid	0	smth	The Windows Phone Developer Power Tools only enable collection of predefined profiles that use certain system events.
guid	0	smth	There appears to be no way to tell it to collect data from your own custom event sources.
guid	0	smth	So although in, e.g., .NET-based store apps, the System.Diagnostics.Tracing.EventSource class is available and can be used to generate custom ETW events, there doesn't appear to be any point to this at the moment because you can't actually record those events in a trace!
guid	0	smth	Just to be clear, this is *not* a duplicate of http://wpdev.uservoice.com/forums/110705-dev-platform/suggestions/3743880-please-provide-etw-logging-from-a-windows-phone-8 - as a reply in that thread points out, you can already log ETW events from a WP8 app.
guid	1	smth	What I want is the ability to record those alongside system-provided ETW events, so that I can see how my code's activity fits in with system behaviour.

guid	1	smth	Please get back the old OneDrive integration to windows phone 8.1.
guid	0	smth	It used to sync so fast and was able to view the pictures under photo albums easily.
guid	0	smth	And now the app takes long time to load.
guid	0	smth	The same happened with Facebook integration.
guid	0	smth	It used to be good on 7.8.
guid	0	smth	We could minimize or maximize the pictures but now we can only maximize.
guid	0	smth	I purchased the windows phone because of the smooth integration but now we are slowly moving towards apps and no OS integration.
guid	0	smth	Microsoft provide a system event SmsReceived for app to be notified when a SMS received, we also need such event for phone call, such as PhoneReveived...
guid	1	smth	Moreover, it's better to have read-only API for phone call history, so developer can help to make better phone call related app like Android.
guid	0	smth	make the mapicon of the windows phone sdk 8.1 able to be on top by the use of zindex make the event tapped accessible for mapicon too
guid	1	smth	Allow the messaging application to join in the default messaging application (Hub Message) for full interaction.
guid	0	smth	-applications use the API of the Hub message for send/view/delete/etc... SMS -The message Hub uses the API of others applications for the same thing (send/view/delete/etc... messages).
guid	0	smth	This means, that the developper have the ablity to implement other application APIs in the message hub and use it
guid	0	smth	In some countries this does not work via provider services.
guid	1	smth	Include an API to add, remove, deactivate tracking protection lists (TPL), to further drive down data usage, enable selective protection against rogue sites tracking, and just having a sense of control.
guid	0	smth	Just like on desktop IE.
guid	0	smth	things i think about is like understanding dates and times.
guid	0	smth	when planning a new agenda item for example this is done nicely.
guid	0	smth	Pivot and panorama controls should have options to enable/disable wrapping.
guid	0	smth	Also the scroll viewer should have options to disable overscrolling effect.

guid	0	smth	This has broken my app Swipe Tunes as I hastilly submitted a WP8.1 update with Transparent Tile and realised later that fast resume was causing issues with my secondary tiles etc.
guid	0	smth	Fast resume has pretty much killed my app and I can't delete the WP8.1 XAP from the store, and as such it looks like my app will not be able to go back on the WP Store or if it does it will have to be under a new name and abandon previous customers.

guid	0	smth	Google wallet has been able to do this for almost 3 years now.
guid	0	smth	Just YouTube using Google Wallet at McD.
guid	0	smth	Support for this would destroy any argument for an apple device because they aren't going to do this any time soon and it would close the gap in functionality between WP and android.

guid	0	smth	I've seen some suggestions that are close to what we need, but not quite, and are marked as completed.
guid	0	smth	I don't know why there is no support for current devices to read NFC cards/tags in full at a low level.
guid	0	smth	Seems deceptive to say that the device has NFC capabilities if in reality it can only read a very specific type of tag.
guid	0	smth	For one of our products we need to support NFC card reading/writing with existing devices and several types of cards (Mifare, UL, ULC, Calypso, Desfire, maybe even more) I've read that for WP8.1 the functionality will be added but only for devices with a specific NFC chipset which is currently not present in any of the devices.
guid	1	smth	So please provide the low-level reading/writing functionality for NFC devices already in the field.

guid	0	smth	When porting my Windows 8 app to Windows Phone 8, I feel that the Universal App template (which is already awesome) could do some other things to increase even more productivity: 1 - Create Pages and UserControl folders: Let's face it, unless we want to create sh**** apps, we won't have the same UI for all platforms, so we'll end up creating the same pages and controls in BOTH versions.
guid	0	smth	VS2013 could create those folders in each project and bring in the classes (pages and user controls) from the original project.
guid	0	smth	I have stated the folder names I use (Pages and UserControls) but the rule could deal with other names as well.
guid	0	smth	2 - I use SettingsFlyouts and I took some time to replicate them as pages in the Windows Phone project.
guid	1	smth	That could be automatic too.
guid	0	smth	3 - Likewise, top and bottom app bars in Windows 8 could be translated into the Windows Phone versions automatically, if for example buttons were found in those controls.
guid	0	smth	4 - Do the same for Styles.xaml (or whatever file contains Templates and Styles) as done in 1.
guid	0	smth	I believe that other kinds of automatic measures could be taken, but I only remember these 4 because I ported a very simple app.
guid	1	smth	I recognize that when Threshold arrives (code matching between Windows and Windows Phone achieves 100%), much of these may not matter anymore, but for the time being these would be nice additions.
guid	0	smth	I have stated the folder names I use (Pages___ more
guid	0	smth	I wished that PubCenter had a way of merging apps that I had in both platforms (Windows and Windows Phone), which obviously includes Universal Apps.
guid	0	smth	When using headphones, music will pause if Cortanta notifies you of an incoming text message.
guid	0	smth	Music will then continue to play once you respond to the notification.
guid	0	smth	However, Podacasts do not pause and will continue to play (inaudibly) in the background as you interact with Cortanta.
guid	1	smth	This is a bug and should be fixed so that ANY media that is playing will be paused if you are interacting with Cortanta.
guid	1	smth	The trial feature should be built-in with automatic enforcement, user prompting, disabling, etc, just as it is in the Windows Store.
guid	0	smth	In the Windows store, I can choose trial mode for my app, and then pick the number of days I want the trial to last.
guid	0	smth	From there, everything is taken care of for me.
guid	0	smth	If the user uninstalls during a trial, it tracks this fact and prevents them from starting a new trial later.
guid	0	smth	Contrast this with the Windows Phone world, where the developer indicates trial mode in the store, but has to manually track the number of days since install, whether the user has purchased, etc.
guid	0	smth	If the user uninstalls and installs again later, the developer has no idea.
guid	0	smth	Adding trial-mode in Windows Phone feels like implement-and-pray.
guid	0	smth	I absolutely love the Windows Store implementation.
guid	1	smth	With the two stores combining, can we bring built-in trial mode support to Windows Phone?
guid	0	smth	Contrast this with the Windows Phone world, where the developer indicates trial mode in the store, but has to manually track the number of days___ more

guid	0	smth	It would be much less frustrating for Windows/Windows Phone developers to have hints sent with the certification failed reports, which make it easier to tackle obvious issues that arise because of the restrictions of Windows/ Windows Phone.
guid	0	smth	It is quite hard to find a solution to something you never heard about before but with the right pointers/keywords it could be done efficiently and nearly effortlessly.
guid	0	smth	As example for an obvious issue and easy solution, if you know something about the problem: My app failed certification because of dark/light theme problems.
guid	0	smth	I set the background to a fixed color (black) in the code and in the light theme the font color is set from white to black by Windows Phone automatically, hence no text is readable.
guid	0	smth	This problem occured at multiple tens of code places in my case.
guid	0	smth	"Adding the following four lines to a report, that probably has been sent out thousands of times, would have saved myself more than an hour of searching for an efficient solution and reading: ---------------------- This might help with Dark/Light theme problems: - - (Visibility)Application.Current.Resources[""PhoneDarkThemeVisibility""]; or similar - (Brush)Application.Current.Resources[""PhoneBackgroundBrush""]; ---------------------- and maybe additional links to documentation It would be much less frustrating for Windows/Windows Phone developers to have hints sent with the certification failed reports, which make it easier to tackle obvious issues that arise because of the restrictions of Windows/ Windows Phone."

guid	0	smth	For all countries prices are automatically set.
guid	0	smth	In Windows Phone Store we are able to set the price for each county separately.
guid	1	smth	We need this also in Windows App Store because: 1.
guid	0	smth	Exchange rate between US$ and ___ is too low.
guid	0	smth	The rate is set to 1-1.
guid	0	smth	Because we calculate our prices in ___ we have to change the $ price for all countries with $ manually and there are a lot of countries to change.
guid	0	smth	We are not willing to charge less in US or Canada than in Europe 2.
guid	0	smth	Change exchange rate between Argentina, Indonesia, South Africa.
guid	0	smth	The rates are too low, so we have set the values manually 3.
guid	0	smth	Checkbox to add additional fee of 13.9% on top of the normal Store Fee (percentage of Net Receipts) that is deducted in calculating our Application Proceeds for these markets: Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Malaysia, Mexico, Peru, South Africa.
guid	0	smth	This fee applies only to alternative payment methods (e.g.
guid	0	smth	carrier billing) and not to credit card transactions in Windows Phone Store we are publishing the same apps in Windows Phone Store and Windows App Store.
guid	0	smth	Because we calculate our prices in ___ we___ more
guid	0	smth	Currently it is not possible to change the package identity name of an app once it has been published, which is a bit frustrating.
guid	0	smth	Users don't like to wait, when they click on app.
guid	0	smth	Splash screen for app is making my consumers wait for actual screens to load.
guid	1	smth	I think Microsoft needs to re-consider about having splash screens.
guid	1	smth	when users click on APP they should directly see UI no lags.
guid	0	smth	Let normal http:// URIs to be able to send notifications to the app using the window.external.notify and not only the https:// URIs.
guid	0	smth	Give the power to the developer to decide if a page is allowed to use the ScriptNotify event or not!
guid	1	smth	Extend the MediaElement to support YouTube videos, so simple.
guid	0	smth	Most probably you will have to collaborate with Google but this is the challenge!
guid	0	smth	Unleash the developers power, the Store is going to win!
guid	0	smth	This bug is easy to reproduce: var wbmp = new WriteableBitmap(480,640); await wbmp.SetSourceAsync(stream); //the stream comes from a picture with larger size, i.e.
guid	0	smth	960x1280 Now check the properties of wbmp: PixelWidth: 960 PixelHeight: 1280 PixelBuffer.Length: 1228800 The length of PixelBuffer is totally wrong, the buffer size shoud be 960 x 1280 x 4 = 4915200 The wrong value 1228800 comes from the original size: 480 x 640 x 4.
guid	1	smth	I think this is a bug, because I think if the WriteableBitmap decides to update the PixelWidth and PixelHeight property, it should also update the PixelBuffer, or the data is inconsistent.
guid	0	smth	The era of connected TV is here.
guid	1	smth	Windows developers need APIs to control TV tuners and display of other digital media on the same screen at the same time
guid	1	smth	make multitasking a real thing, like seeing a video or having a mini calc when browse some thing.
guid	1	smth	you can limit number of apps according to the screen size.
guid	1	smth	Please add api's for sharing to reading list.
guid	0	smth	It is a useful feature.

guid	0	smth	I have found no way to get the Information, that the user has set his format settings to irish.
guid	1	smth	And my only wish is to format a DateTime like the user wants to see it.
guid	0	smth	Regional Format does not automaticly mean the region i set the device to or the UI Langauge i chose.

guid	0	smth	Apps on Windows Phone were able to run under the lock screen for quite some time.
guid	0	smth	The new universal app model does not provide this functionality.
guid	1	smth	This should be added in future versions as it is still an important feature for some apps.
guid	0	smth	Windows Phone 8.1 introduces the Social Extensibility Framework.
guid	0	smth	It allows third-party apps to integrate into the People Hub's 'What's New' feed, etc.
guid	0	smth	Currently this integration is locked and only select app developers are given access.
guid	0	smth	The documentation on the Windows.Phone.SocialIntegration namespace is also limited.
guid	1	smth	I would like Microsoft to open up this framework to all developers.
guid	0	smth	I understand this framework is still being developed and real-word usage must first be measured.
guid	1	smth	But why not allow it to be used locally by sideloading or through the emulators?
guid	0	smth	I think we could provide valuable feedback and come up with exciting scenario's for using this framework.
guid	0	smth	I have create and export from my projects the win8.1 app and with the instructions you provide into your site I'm trying to install the app to win8.
guid	0	smth	The cert.
guid	0	smth	is installed successfully.
guid	0	smth	But when I'm trying to install the app I'm getting an error.
guid	0	smth	StoreApp\AppStudio.Windows_1.0.0.0_AnyCPU.appx
guid	0	smth	Would allow binding to isvisible in an mvvm scenario.
guid	0	smth	Possibly some other property named parent to choose where popup is revealed from.
guid	0	smth	again suitable for mvvm.
guid	1	smth	I'd like to record an audio/video file while playing a audio file in the background.
guid	0	smth	The reason I got into this is because I figured If any company could do it Microsoft could and then I find out that I can't.
guid	0	smth	Now my killer app has to wait for windows to catch up again.
guid	0	smth	I don't know if you have to have two sets of speakers or two microphones or a way to separate left speaker from right but It would make a whole lot of devs happy to be able to do this
guid	0	smth	It is more convenient to go with swiping gestures is more fun being with than the tap method.
guid	1	smth	However, there should be more of swipe gestures than the tap methods.
guid	0	smth	To set a difference a swipe to the right should launch 'settings' menu, as a swipe to the left launches the 'apps list'.
guid	0	smth	Currently I'm developing an app for posting photos to a user's Picasa account.
guid	0	smth	A user has requested that the app provide functionality to edit a given photo from their account and upload a new version.
guid	0	smth	I don't think it's best of my resources to implement this functionality when there are so many great photo editing apps already on the market.
guid	1	smth	I would like the ability to pass the photo from my app to an app (of the user's choice via an app picker) that supports the selected photo type.
guid	0	smth	The user can then do some function within the selected app (e.g.
guid	1	smth	add a filter, crop, etc), and then the opened app can pass that edited file back to my app.
guid	0	smth	This would extend the power already available with share pickers to perform more generic tasks, and would result in a better experience for the user.
guid	0	smth	All this while keeping the sandbox mentality that the OS has.
guid	0	smth	This should be available both in WinRT and Silverlight applications.
guid	0	smth	The user can then do some function within the selected app___ more
guid	1	smth	A thing that would be increbible is that your phone make a sound when you whistle or Clap hands a certain pattern ( wich could be preseted by the phone owner ) so when you can't find your phone and you dont have a buddy around to text you, you can find it!
guid	1	smth	Lockscreen: -Should be able to chose a tiny black outline around lettering so you can see what's written properly when you have a Clear/White lock screen.

guid	1	smth	Could you please have a report that includes the prices, before the final payment?
guid	0	smth	Companies need to have the correct sales estimate for the accounts purposes.
guid	0	smth	Windows 8.1 SDK brought a lot of built in transitions, making easier to develop a native-like app.
guid	0	smth	But I'm missing that list animations seen on Settings or Messaging apps when opening or closing them.
guid	0	smth	There are properties like IsStaggeringEnabled and IsStaggerElement in the CommonNavigationInfo class, but the animations doesn't feel like the native one.
guid	0	smth	Thanks and keep up the good work with Windows Phone!
guid	1	smth	Make necessary conditions so that developers choose proper (representing application )high quality images as application symbols in store matching modern ui Now many apps has simply ugly icons,pixelated,Android like ,pirated ,misleading,..
guid	0	smth	Many times apps/games were made free for limited time as offers promotions .
guid	0	smth	But we users misses out,need a category showing apps gone free , price change,limited time offers like red stripe deals
guid	0	smth	IE in WP8.1 (with all updates) gives error/doesn't load page if the body tag contains onLoad window.location function (i.e.

guid	0	smth	Tried backup and restore yesterday.
guid	0	smth	It seems wp8.1 does not backup and then restore all the apps.
guid	0	smth	Mostly, Nokia's and Here's apps (some examples: Nokia camera, Here Maps, Here Drive+) were not backed up.
guid	0	smth	I needed to install these manually.
guid	0	smth	Some other Nokia apps that were installed by default when I bought the phone (photo and video related apps) were not restored either.
guid	0	smth	"Also, after I restored the phone, Here Maps and Here Drive+ tiles had ""!"""
guid	0	smth	sign and saying that these apps do not even exist in the store any more.
guid	0	smth	But of course they exist in the store.
guid	0	smth	I installed these manually later.
guid	0	smth	Some of my contact had different than default ringtone.
guid	0	smth	Those were not restored either.
guid	0	smth	All contacts had the same ringtone.
guid	0	smth	Glance screen settings and when it goes to night mode were not backed up and restored.

guid	0	smth	I recently had to use this API for a private client certificate.
guid	0	smth	"And I was surprised to read in the MSDN that it returns ""nothing"" as a result of its async call."
guid	0	smth	I would really have thought it returns the just imported pfx.
guid	0	smth	"So here is my scenario and you can clearly see why this API change would help to improve the code flow: var clientCert; ensureCertficatesAsync = function() { logger.trace(""Checking client certificate""); if (clientCert) { logger.info(""Using already loaded client certificate""); return WinJS.Promise.as(clientCert); } var certQuery = new Certificates.CertificateQuery(); certQuery.friendlyName = ""Client Cert""; return Certificates.CertificateStores.findAllAsync(certQuery).then(function(certs) { if (!certs.length) { return Windows.Storage.StorageFile.getFileFromApplicationUriAsync(""ms-appx:///cert/client.pfx""); }).then(Windows.Storage.FileIO.readBufferAsync).then(function(buffer) { var pfx = Windows.Security.Cryptography.CryptographicBuffer.encodeToBase64String(buffer); logger.info(""Installing client certificate""); return Certificates.CertificateEnrollmentManager.importPfxDataAsync( pfx, ""XXXXX"", Certificates.ExportOption.notExportable, Certificates.KeyProtectionLevel.noConsent, Certificates.InstallOptions.none, certQuery.friendlyName ); }).then(function() { // This search in the store could be omitted logger.info(""Client certificate installed""); return Certificates.CertificateStores.findAllAsync(certQuery); }).then(function(certs) { return clientCert = certs[0]; }); } else { logger.info(""Client certificate already installed""); return clientCert = certs[0]; } }); } As you can see after installing the pfx I have to query the store again to fetch the pfx to use it in calls to HttpClient with a filter."
guid	0	smth	This is not a breaking change.

guid	0	smth	To quote from Windows Phone web site https:/dev.windowsphone.com/en-US/OEM/docs/Welcome/Windows_Phone_8.1 ___Windows Phone 8.1 introduces the ability to write certain drivers as user-mode drivers by using UMDF 2.0.
guid	0	smth	With UMDF 2.0, you can write UMDF drivers that use C-style syntax and call many of the same methods that are available to KMDF drivers.___ But this is limited to phone makers OEMs.
guid	0	smth	However since phones are becoming more and more like PCs used to be and hardware extensions are starting to appear, like the Structure Sensor which is designed to work with IPhone and Android.
guid	1	smth	Since UMDF USB drivers are absolutely safe from harming the system thus guarding from penetrating the SP networks, it would be a good idea to allow 3rd party registered device driver developers to be able to develop UMDF signed drivers, submitted for testing and approval for such devices as I mentioned before.

guid	0	smth	Apple provides a similar capability via iTunes Connect (https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/LanguagesUtilities/Conceptual/iTunesConnect_Guide/8_AddingNewApps/AddingNewApps.html).
guid	0	smth	This capability would not only enhance the submission experience, but it would also allow for Store submissions to be added and tracked in the developer's source control system (e.g., TFS, git).
guid	1	smth	Optionally, it would also be great for this capability to support selection of markets and price points that the app is intended to target.
guid	0	smth	As a starting point, it would be fine for the developer to download from the Dev Center a 'starter template' that is a ZIP file with basic XML templates and placeholder filenames, which the developer could then tweak/modify for the app she wants to submit.

guid	0	smth	I want to log a complaint on unequal developer treatment by DPE East Africa.
guid	0	smth	There is alot of unequal favoritism going on with regards to developer support on issues like Windows Testing Devices.

guid	0	smth	Unequal judging process based on friendship merits rather than app quality.
guid	0	smth	Any one here can see its down right nepotistic.

guid	0	smth	HTTP stack will help us to write complete web server inside phone, that could be use for hosting webpage, downloading files from phone via browser etc

guid	0	smth	Currently a file is simply flagged as deleted.
guid	0	smth	The file is not removed from storage.
guid	0	smth	In todays criminal/government spy world, simply flagging a file as deleted does not secure it from prying eyes.
guid	1	smth	Please consider adding an option to erase a file by overwriting the bits with garbage and also the catalog entry/file name.
guid	0	smth	The actual erasure can be a background process.
guid	0	smth	Also consider adding a group policy to enforce erasure.
guid	1	smth	Hey, Please Please make the classes in above framework like SongCollection, Playlists etc immutable and unabstract.
guid	0	smth	Right now its impossible to create a custom playlist in a media player app without transferring all the songs to ISO.
guid	0	smth	It will be very easy if the classes are immutable and song collection class can be used simply as a list where one can add or remove Song just like other collections so that MediaPlayer.Play(SongCollection coll) can be used more effectively.

guid	0	smth	When you apply new policies on already existing, especially if it is related to name, all the existing credibility and market is lost.
guid	0	smth	App is in store with current policies at that time, there is no point applying new policies and make developer to work on old stuff.
guid	0	smth	When you are developing an app, the generic policies will make sense.
guid	0	smth	But when a developer submitted an app and it's failing for a reason/policies, it's worth sending a developer exactly what happened with his/her app.
guid	0	smth	What are the things went wrong, rather than saying your app failing on 2.11 (it's generic message) will be no use, as the app is already developed reading these policies and with the understanding of these policies.
guid	0	smth	If you simply say an app failed with the policy number 2.11 or so, what can a developer benefit out of it, rather he will be more confused and after a couple of times, it will be frustrating.
guid	0	smth	After a little while, developer may think that, anyway they are not going thru, what's the point in spending time here.
guid	1	smth	Be responsible and give more & specific details, why an app failed rather than pointing a policies which talks about several things.
guid	0	smth	May be this works with a firm/company, but for independent developers you are the source & you are the helper.

guid	0	smth	Windows 8 phone default calculator is annoying without being able to copy and paste numbers into the calculator app.
guid	0	smth	I find myself having to manually tab out get figures, enter them in.
guid	1	smth	Easy fix add copy and paste function for adding figures and copying out figures.
guid	0	smth	Windows 8 phone.
guid	1	smth	Needs copy & paste functions to import export figures in and out of the calculator.
guid	0	smth	Copy any number of the internet / documents and try and put it into calculator app.
guid	0	smth	You will find you have to do it manually.
guid	0	smth	Namely the file that was replaced.
guid	0	smth	It would make chaining additional operations much more easier!
guid	0	smth	Having to RE enter things like version number, application name, etc when submitting a new app is just grounds for making mistakes.
guid	0	smth	In the App manifest I've already put the version number, and I've already put the application name.
guid	0	smth	When I upload this XAP to the store, look at the manifest and pre-populate the corresponding fields in my submission instead of giving me a chance to mismatch them.
guid	0	smth	My wifi is terrible after 8.1 update.

guid	0	smth	Now I can get it standing outside the wall from the router.
guid	0	smth	My idea - Large size of tiles - Interactive live tiles, we can next, pause, prev songs at xbox music live tiles, read mail without open app, etc... - Photo background, (no more dark or light), like windows 8.
guid	1	smth	Let's make windows phone more colorful !
guid	1	smth	- All apps can be sort by name, date installed, most used,... - Official app folder for all windows phones - Name group like windows - Why not make settings like control panel in windows 8 ?
guid	0	smth	It's some idea, please VOTE !!!

guid	0	smth	Currently when the dialogue with first level of Windows Phone Store support is broken there is not any option to reach higher level and talk with someone who could resolve any kind of misunderstanding.
guid	0	smth	Windows Phone Support team can simply refuse further communication and everything stops there.
guid	0	smth	And unbelievably they are doing exactly that.
guid	0	smth	Azure support system is a very good example how this should work.
guid	0	smth	In every communication emails the support officer's manager and generic escalation emails are included.
guid	1	smth	Please do the same for Windows Phone Store unless you want to leave the developers and therefore the end users let down because of sub-pair support quality.
guid	0	smth	Microsoft has to understand that refusing adequate support to developers will strike back as thousands of customers, who are using that same publisher's applications will be left without further updates and improvements.

guid	0	smth	There are some bugs in notification center.If there are so many notifications in notification center then it lags when i scroll it down.. i don't know that others are facing this problem or not but i think its a major issue...
guid	0	smth	I found something (which I think of as serious security bug).
guid	0	smth	I'll start with the fact that I've got NOKIA L920 ith WP8.1 preview for developers.
guid	0	smth	What else could be important is that I've set additional security code (so I've got two codes, first for SIM card and second my own internal code which should be typed after a long time of phone inactivity).
guid	0	smth	I noticed that after the reboot of my mobile phone I can skip SIM code (simply by pulling the screen down - like clsing an app), and then i only need to type my internal code (in about 3/4 cases SIM code panel will pop up, but in the other 1/4 no).
guid	0	smth	I can use all phone features except calling, but getting access to other data is terrifying too.
guid	0	smth	I checked it a few times.
guid	0	smth	So my concern is that what will happen when someone uses only SIM code?
guid	0	smth	And what may cause that phenomenon?
guid	0	smth	I noticed that after the reboot of my mobile phone I can skip SIM code (simply by pulling the screen down - like clsing an app), and then i only need to type my internal code___ more
guid	0	smth	Currently windows phone is very restricted for developers.
guid	0	smth	It is not at all flexible.
guid	0	smth	Whatsapp cant send audios, truecaller cant interpret incoming calls, we cant access the list of apps installed and numerous others too.
guid	0	smth	all this is because of a simple reason 'Security' which is important in corporate companies but casual users are more out there.
guid	1	smth	they shouldn't be restricted like this.
guid	1	smth	so please develop two variants of windows phone OS.
guid	0	smth	Enterprise which will be the one that we have today and a basic version will be more flexible, more open for users and developers
guid	1	smth	Make SD boot fresh each time phone is restarted or double files with nothing in them to play then error 80070057
guid	0	smth	Start button for notification light .. Calls , msg, all notification
guid	0	smth	When using MapElement derived controls, such as MapPolygon, expose a Tap event.
guid	0	smth	Or don't make these objects sealed, so that we can add the needed functionality ourselves.
guid	1	smth	WP need to provide API'S that allow developers to develop apps like APP locker (That locks specific apps)..Using phone with lock not enough.
guid	1	smth	"Hi, Please add the From To options right after ""Download new email"" under each email account to specify when the phone is allowed to check emails."
guid	0	smth	Due to some spam emails the phone alerts me about new emails in the middle of the night.
guid	0	smth	It's extremely annoying.
guid	0	smth	Even my old phone Nokia E71 running on Symbian had an opportunity to specify the time period during which new emails will be checked.
guid	0	smth	The new Geolocator API and implementation is so unreliable, that it can't be used with any confidence in a product.
guid	0	smth	Problems I have encountered: 1) While using PositionChanged event Geolocator.ReportInterval seems to be ignored.
guid	0	smth	The simulator does a reasonable job of honouring the reporting interval, phones seem to ignore it completely e.g.
guid	0	smth	ReportInterval set to 1 second, the phone would regularly take 30 - 45 seconds and sometimes minutes to report.
guid	0	smth	As a developer I expect the ReportInterval to be honoured with a high degree of accuracy.
guid	0	smth	If the Phone doesn't have an accurate location, simply return what it does have.
guid	0	smth	2) GetPositionAsync() and GetGeopositionAsync(TimeSpan, TimeSpan) regularly never return.
guid	0	smth	Because the event based location reporting is unreliable I have tried to use these APIs instead, unfortunately they are also unreliable.
guid	0	smth	The GetGeopositionAsync method will work maybe 15 times in a row and then simply stop working and never return... despite having a timeout parameter!??
guid	0	smth	3) In general the API is poorly designed.
guid	0	smth	Changing properties on an active Gelocator causes exceptions.
guid	0	smth	Getting the Geolocator to actually do something requires getting the magical (and undocumented) setting of properties correct and then attaching event handlers i.e.
guid	0	smth	the API is too implicit it works on side-effect rather than deliberate commands.
guid	0	smth	If the Phone doesn't have an accurate location, simply return what it does___ more
guid	0	smth	It is showing the status 'generating' for the past 1 hour.
guid	0	smth	The Online Media extensibility is fantastic, however it would be better if you allowed more sorting abilities for albums, pictures and videos.
guid	0	smth	Currently the sorting is: Albums = Title Acsending Pictures & Albums = CreationTimestamp Acesending It would be good if there was more sorting (either via the photo hub or via code) which allows all items to be sorted title\creation timestamp\last updated timestamp ascending\descending.
guid	0	smth	Hi, forcing all WP8 apps upgraded to WP81 to behave differently on resume is causing me massive headaches.

guid	0	smth	PLEASE!!!!!!!
guid	0	smth	Thanks!!!
guid	1	smth	"Selecting ""Apps updated"" message in Windows Phone 8.1 notification center should jump directly to app download history, instead of jumping to the Store app but not showing the history."
guid	0	smth	Currently three additional but unnecessary actions are required to show the downloads history (after '.. Apps updated' was selected in notification center): 1 expand menu bar, 2 select downloads, 3 swipe to history:
guid	1	smth	Please provide a Quick Menu for Windows Phone - something comparable to Win-x menu in Windows 8(.1) but with possibility to edit and add menu items by the user.
guid	1	smth	The menu should be triggered by press-and-holding the standard Windows key.
guid	0	smth	That key combination is still free and the most logical place for a quick menu.

guid	0	smth	I then used SharpDx for my app.
guid	0	smth	I also couldn't create a Mediaelement in Codebehind because it needs a strange path for phones and throws an exception.

guid	0	smth	As an app publisher in South Africa, I am currently unable to get any sort of proper tax invoice for purchases made through my developer account.
guid	0	smth	This makes me incredibly unpopular with my accountant!
guid	0	smth	Would it not be possible to generate a simple invoice and email it to me?
guid	0	smth	Currently MS only seems to send snail mail invoices and only to certain countries (way to go in leading the way with technology in business!!)
guid	0	smth	Anyway, Im sure that Im not the only one who has this issue so if we could look at some email invoices it would be great.
guid	1	smth	Because I receive a lot of spam flashSMS which I delete immediately, I need a possibility to add phone numbers to blocked list manually.
guid	0	smth	I cannot pick the number from unanswered calls or somewhere else, because those numbers are not stored in my phone.
guid	0	smth	Hi, Currently WP8.1 allows to backup images so that low quality via data or high quality via wifi.
guid	1	smth	For security reasons, I'd really like to see an option that if the high quality backup via wifi is enabled and if the phone is not currently connected to wifi, then the phone automatically creates resized (smaller) photo and uploads it via data to the cloud and then delete's the resized photo from the phone.
guid	0	smth	Then, when the phone finds wifi and is able to connect, it back up the original high quality picture and deletes the resized photo from the cloud too.
guid	0	smth	How's that for security?
guid	0	smth	Lets assume the phone is set not to automatically connect every available wifi network or there is no free wifi available.
guid	0	smth	The thief may take a photo, but if only the wifi backup option is enabled, but there is no wifi available for the phone, then the picture stays in the phone.
guid	0	smth	But if it were possible to automatically resize the image in the phone and upload it via data, then it would be available for the phone's real owner.
guid	0	smth	The thief could take a picture of him/herself (then it can be given to police) and/or give idea of his/her location.
guid	0	smth	Then, when the phone finds wifi and is able to connect, it back up the original high quality picture and deletes the resized photo from the cloud___ more
guid	1	smth	Please add the possibility to open HTML files that are located in the folders in the phone's memory.
guid	0	smth	Lumia 925 running on wp8.1 with all the updates has extremely bad gsm (both 3g and 4g) signal reception.

guid	0	smth	At the same time other mobile phones working under the same operator have strong 4-5 bar signal.
guid	0	smth	If this is a bug in wp8.1 then please fix it.

guid	0	smth	I wonder what may cause this.
guid	0	smth	At home I use wifi.
guid	0	smth	Could it be that when I leave home and phone switches to 4G, the switch causes apps to close?
guid	0	smth	My phone (Lumia 925) has WP8.1 with all updates.
guid	0	smth	Or, is the no of background apps limited and oldest ones are being closed when new ones (including menues left open) come on?
guid	1	smth	Can there please be an app that denies access to an app unless given a correct pin?
guid	0	smth	Android has third-party apps that can block your apps/games with a password.
guid	1	smth	Can Microsoft Corporation make a similar app, please?
guid	0	smth	I would really appreciate it.
guid	0	smth	Thanks, and don't forget to vote
guid	1	smth	I would like to be able to pull in Bing news search results for a specified keyword

guid	0	smth	Just like Stardock's Deskscapes for Windows PC's.
guid	0	smth	You get to choose what video you like and it plays over and over again,the trick is to not notice the end and the start of the video,easiest to do on waterfall videos...
guid	0	smth	I hope you like the idea,i bet many people would like to have spinning earth,wind blowing,river streaming,waterfalls,etc on their lockscreen.
guid	0	smth	Please let me know is it possible to do.
guid	0	smth	In the current version anyone can read or remove notifications when screen is locked, without knowing the password.
guid	0	smth	The location icon appears at the top but had not been selected or activated.
guid	0	smth	Why only APPS, Pictures, Music & Videos can get saved to SD card?
guid	0	smth	How about downloaded Maps too?
guid	1	smth	It would be nice to be able to load XAML from string without freezing UI - it could easily take over 200ms to load a short bit of XAML.
guid	1	smth	It would be extremely helpful if the reminder/alarm API supported creating a reminder for specific days of the week.
guid	0	smth	Example: Create a reminder that starts today, ends in month, and reminds the user every Tue.

guid	0	smth	I understand that it makes sense to only show app reviews only in those countrys were they come from.
guid	0	smth	E.g.
guid	0	smth	a German review should only be shown in Germany (and maybe in Switzerland and Austria).
guid	0	smth	What I don't understand is, that you also showing the app rating in countries, were they come from.
guid	0	smth	For example: An app has 20 ratings.
guid	0	smth	15 from Germany (all with 4 stars), 1 from USA (1 star) and 4 from France (5 stars) If you now open the app in the Windows Phone Store from Germany, you will see a total app review rating of 15 (4 stars).
guid	0	smth	If you open the app in the US Windows Phone Store, it shows only 1 rating with 1 star.
guid	0	smth	In France it shows 4 ratings with 5 stars and in all other countries it shows 0 ratings!
guid	0	smth	The total rating should be equal worldwide!
guid	0	smth	:-) I understand that it makes sense to only show app reviews only in those countrys were they come from.
guid	0	smth	15 from Germany (all with 4 stars), 1 from USA (1 star) and 4 from France (5 stars) If you now open the app in the Windows Phone Store from Germany, you will see a total app review rating of___ more

guid	0	smth	Right now it is very difficult (and completely undocumented) to determine if a photo or picture is marked as a favorite by a user, or to retrieve a list of favorites (similar to getting the list of pictures in the KnownFolders.CameraRoll, etc).
guid	0	smth	If a user has taken the time to mark pictures as favorites, we should celebrate that and make it simple for developers to use that in their own applications.
guid	0	smth	When you use the PhotoChooserTask and specify a PixelWidth and PixelHeight, when an image is chosen, the user is provided with a cropping tool that is outstanding and difficult to duplicate.
guid	1	smth	Please provide a PhotoCropTask that takes an Image(Byte[]) and provides the same crop tool.
guid	1	smth	Include a PixelHeight and PixelWidth as optional parameters so an aspect ratio can be included.
guid	1	smth	Microsoft should do approach with developer aplication service and makers of office space in order to them to make the aplication run on Windows Phone 7, 7.5, 7.8, 8, 8.1 for all brand (Nokia, HTC, Samsung etc)
guid	0	smth	I understand you have security considerations to consider, however i cannot think of any reason we should not be able to check if a sms is received.
guid	1	smth	Extend the ScheduledNotification.RecurrenceType options beyond Daily, Weekly, Monthly, EndOfMonth, Yearly to allow more options: For example, every 4 days, every 2 weeks, every Quarter, every 6 month, etc.

guid	1	smth	It would be cool to allow the ApplicationBar to have more icons available.
guid	0	smth	So it could stick with the same 4 row limit but could allow for wrapping so if there were 7 items, the applicationbar would expand to allow for the 2nd row of icons.
guid	1	smth	It would be also cool to allow for more than one application bar per page, so you could specify one at the top, left, bottom or right.
guid	1	smth	The bottom could be quick links while the top or left side could be used for navigational purposes.
guid	1	smth	Please Combine All Windows Phone SKDs into one installation File, so people download only one file and then check each version of WP SDKs that they want to install.

guid	0	smth	Hi, I think it's useful if both windows phone 8.x and windows 8.x will have a similar way to access filesystem content and implement ALL the APIs here: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/hh465199.aspx http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/hh464978.aspx http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/windows.storage.knownfolders.aspx http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/jj218966.aspx In particular, having only the possibility of accessing media files through the XNA API doesn't deliver a UX on par with other platforms.

Hi, I think it's useful if both windows phone 8.x and windows 8.x will have a similar way to access filesystem content and implement ALL the APIs here: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/hh465199.aspx http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/hh464978.aspx http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/windows.storage.knownfolders.aspx http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/jj218966.aspx In particular, having only the possibility of accessing media files through the XNA API doesn't deliver a UX on par with other platforms.

guid	1	smth	Hi Please extend Song Class with more useful properties such as LastPlayedDate, AddedDate.
guid	1	smth	And optimize SongCollection to support similar filters.
guid	0	smth	"These properties will allow developers to introduce many useful features such as Auto playlists, and it'll also help xbox team to bring back ""Recently Added"" feature."
guid	0	smth	Full unsafe code support would: 1) Allow more code to be shared across platforms, and 2) Increase the performance of applications that needed it.
guid	0	smth	Here's a use case example: I'm the author of BEPUphysics, a real-time simulation library.
guid	0	smth	I wish to support many platforms as best I can with as much common code as possible.
guid	0	smth	Unfortunately, in the current situation, I can't have the best of both worlds.
guid	0	smth	If my goal is optimal performance, I must maintain separate codebases for a bunch of low-level queries and data structures.
guid	0	smth	On the other hand, if my goal is as much common code as possible, I'm forced to use the suboptimal lowest common denominator, crippling all of the other platforms.
guid	0	smth	Over time, these competing motivations have resulted in a codebase that is harder to maintain yet still isn't as fast as it could be.
guid	0	smth	While using C++ could provide the necessary access and performance, many of the potential uses in simulation are sufficiently fine-grained that dropping to C++ from C# repeatedly is at best horribly messy and at worst actually slower.
guid	0	smth	(A full native implementation would address the performance side of things, but I can't justify the massive expense of porting for just one platform.
guid	0	smth	It would also destroy a lot of value for the C#-based users of the library.)
guid	0	smth	Even if fallbacks had to be kept around to support other platforms that didn't allow unsafe code, enabling unsafe code on the phone would allow it to use the same efficient implementations as the PC.

guid	0	smth	The SD Card support in WP8 is practically useless because built-in apps are the only ones allowed to access what are known as 'reserved file and URI associations'.
guid	0	smth	(http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windowsphone/develop/jj207065(v=vs.105).aspx) This means it is impossible to create an app that plays video or audio files stored on the SD card.
guid	0	smth	Many WP8 devices ship with only 8GB, which makes the use of the SD card essential, especially to store large files, such as video.
guid	0	smth	We are presently working on a WP8 version of an app to play sign language videos, but are stymied by this restriction.
guid	0	smth	We cannot read (or even see) any .mp4 files on the SD card.
guid	0	smth	This limitation basically stops our project for WP8.
guid	0	smth	Of course, we have iOS and Android versions that work on phones.
guid	0	smth	Our own project aside, it seems somewhat draconian to disallow any third-party apps from competing with the built-in apps.
guid	0	smth	Just looking at the list of reserved file types - seems like all file types known to man are reserved.
guid	0	smth	And then I remind myself that this is just on the SD card.
guid	0	smth	But then what is the point of the SD card, if the developer is restricted to the phone's internal memory...
guid	0	smth	We cannot read___ more
guid	0	smth	There is SSL/TLS socket support in Windows Phone 8.
guid	0	smth	However, currently no WP8 platform component seems to support SSL certificate pinning.
guid	0	smth	When a SSL connection is created, there is no way to inspect the x.509 certificate chain returned by the remote server.
guid	1	smth	I want to implement certificate pinning for additional security in my app and therefore I need an API to read the values of individual x.509 certificates.
guid	0	smth	This is third time I am stuck in windows phone app development because windows phone 8 doesn't provide a good background service.
guid	0	smth	Running of background service just for 25 seconds every 30 minutes is restricting app developers from creating required apps for clients.
guid	0	smth	My client is a well known home appliances manufacturing company , and they insist on regular update from app even when app is not running , which we successfully implemented in Android and iOS.
guid	0	smth	But because of the restriction in windows phone development over background service client is on the verge of dropping windows phone app for their product.
guid	1	smth	So what I suggest is give flexible background service for development and notify user while installing the app about the background services that will be running and battery consumption it might cause.And then user can decide to install the app or not.

guid	0	smth	However if the user closes the app during these processes the data might be corrupted.

guid	0	smth	One possible use case: A smart watch that uses the phone as a way to access information in the internet.
guid	1	smth	For the most time the watch is disconnected from the phone, but from time to time it could connect to a service running on the phone (maybe timed, maybe because user presses a button on the phone) to send a request, which the service on the phone then handles (some additional data transfer between the phone and watch and the phone and some cloud service may be involved) The actual trigger from device to phone could be done with Bluetooth LE if listening for incomming SPP connections is too much of a drain as long as it would be possible for an application to do some background processing and data transfer based on triggers comming from external hardware accessories.

guid	0	smth	It looks like instances of AudioVideoCaptureDevice automatically dispose when an app is deactivated.
guid	0	smth	The disposal appears to be done in the runtime code, as none of my disposal code runs in these situations.
guid	0	smth	This is an issue when the application returns to the foreground and ActivatedEventArgsIsApplicationInstancePreserved == true, because all application memory should be intact.
guid	0	smth	But it isn't, because the AudioVideoCaptureDevice instance has been auto-magically disposed.

guid	1	smth	Basically implement the IInternetProtocol family of COM interfaces on Windows Phone 8 and allow us to add our own protocol handlers (in the Registry) - it is possible on Windows 8.
guid	1	smth	BatteryManager should provide mechanism to tell us whether phone is plugged in AC or using USB.
guid	0	smth	Right now it only tells me whether the battery source is External or Battery, but 'external' is too generic.
guid	1	smth	It'll be great to have BatterySource.USB and BatterySource.AC (when plugged in) and BatterySource.Battery (when not plugged in).
guid	0	smth	I recently asked myself how long an app takes to get in the store.
guid	0	smth	Especially if there are deadlines to fulfill, it comes in very handy if there is a sort of progressbar indicating how many steps are necessary to get certified.
guid	0	smth	"All other steps are working really smooth but the ""pending certification"" is taking up to 5 days without showing any progress."
guid	0	smth	"""pending certification (33% done)"") in the account?"
guid	1	smth	That would be very nice for all the developers out there waiting for their app so become reality.
guid	0	smth	At the moment there are only APIs for reading and writing NFC Tags.
guid	0	smth	Unfortunately this is only a very small part of the NFC capabilities.
guid	0	smth	With an ISO14443 Smartcard support, you would be able to communicate with Smartcards like being used in public transport or supporting payment via NFC Credit Cards.
guid	0	smth	Have you ever decided not to download an app while browsing the store simply because it did not have any ratings or reviews?
guid	0	smth	If so then this issue should concern you as a developer.
guid	0	smth	So for example if an app is published in Canada and the United States and only the users in Canada leave a rating/reviews then the users in the United States will not see those ratings and could potentially decide not to download the app.
guid	0	smth	This also gives the false impression that your app is not good even though you know that people worldwide are enjoying (or not enjoying) the app.
guid	1	smth	So I am suggesting that Microsoft implement a system to show a consumer all the ratings and reviews.
guid	0	smth	I understand there may be some issues with language etc.
guid	0	smth	Ratings and Reviews are an important part of an app store otherwise why would Microsoft bother having them.
guid	0	smth	Ratings and Reviews are an important part of a developers promotion arsenal... after all who would you rather believe, the seller's ads or user reviews of the app?
guid	0	smth	Not all of us are the Instagrams of the world and depend on each and every ratings we can get.
guid	0	smth	So if you think it is only fair that users see all the reviews in the app store then please support this request by voting for it.
guid	0	smth	This also gives the___ more
guid	0	smth	The idea is to install partially or all the data of the application to cloud services and not to the local device.

guid	0	smth	From an old suggestion which got declined: - Phone off (locked) - Reminder comes up (reminder is setup to open the owner app when tapped) - User taps over reminder, then unlocks: target app is not launched Expected: Tapping over the reminder and then unlocking should take the user to the target app, just as it works when the phone is unlocked and a reminder pops up.
guid	0	smth	(See http://wpdev.uservoice.com/forums/110705-app-platform/suggestions/2321588-bug-click-on-reminder-will-not-open-target-app-w) I really hope Microsoft can resolve this issue, because it is clearly a bug and it definitely does not work as designed.
guid	1	smth	I can understand that tapping on the reminder cannot take me to the app if the screen is locked, but at least, give me a possibility to unlock the screen.
guid	0	smth	Currently, the only options I have is to close the reminder by tapping the snooze, or ignore or the back button.
guid	1	smth	If this is working as designed, then I thing the NavigationUri in the Reminder is unnecessary and should be marked obsolete, or the documentation should be updated with a limitations on the lock screen.

guid	1	smth	I just want to tell you that it will be good if you give option to lock the applications specifically,like sms,..
guid	0	smth	tl;dr: Creating a popular app is a bit of a chicken and egg problem.
guid	1	smth	It would be great to see this circumvented somehow.
guid	1	smth	"One possibility: Instead of having a ""top charts"" style listing, where the most popular apps are displayed to every phone anywhere, create a new form of distribution, where the results are randomized every time a user looks at the marketplace."
guid	0	smth	Now, that obviously has the result of bad apps being near the top a lot, so you modify that with ratings.
guid	1	smth	Highly rated apps should appear near the top more, and they should appear less and less frequently and the rating of the app dwindles.
guid	0	smth	For example, my app is currently fairly well reviewed (4.5 stars).
guid	0	smth	"However, it NEVER gets good visibility because it isn't the ""best"", which is actually subject to a very wide variety of opinions."
guid	1	smth	It seems to me that all good apps/games should have a chance at decent exposure in the top charts, and waiting to be featured just isn't worth it.
guid	1	smth	Another option is to do this with the featured apps in the marketplace.
guid	1	smth	Instead of ten featured games per day which all users see, it would be better for each user to see a random set of games each time the marketplace is viewed.
guid	0	smth	In this way, every decent game would get a considerable amount of exposure each day, while apps that had a rough beginning could mend their flaws and become successful apps.
guid	1	smth	There are a lot of reasons why this might be difficult, but I feel that with a little bit of thought this could be a very profitable idea, both for developers and for Microsoft.
guid	0	smth	My two cents.
guid	1	smth	Highly rated apps should appear near the top more, and they should appear less and less___ more

guid	0	smth	"Since apps aren't allowed to modify files on sd cards I wanted to write a desktop sync app that would examine the device for any files that have been ""disliked"" and then remove them."
guid	0	smth	However this is impossible with all existing API's.
guid	1	smth	If I have an app that shows a filtered subset of a user's contacts, I should have a way to click on that user and show the user's details in the native experience.
guid	0	smth	I am familiar with the suggestion to take the contact's details and re-create them in your own UI... which would be great if the API exposed all of the user's details (like the Anniversary) which it does not.
guid	0	smth	Also, having a ShowContactTask would allow me to give my user a quick shortcut to post a message on Twitter or Facebook without having to implement those SDKs (especially since the APIs do not currently give you access to social networking contacts to be able to pull their social network handles).

guid	1	smth	Please expose the ID property for Contacts and Appointments.
guid	0	smth	At the moment it is private (and inaccessible via Reflection because of trust levels), which makes unique contact/appointment identification impossible.

guid	0	smth	It takes a lot of time.
guid	1	smth	I would like to ask Microsoft to give us a tool(option in emulator) with which we can take screenshots once, in one emulator and it will produce screenshots in all resolutions and all languages supported by our app.

guid	0	smth	"In WP8, the default Pivot control now correctly displays the title text at the top of the page with the PhoneFontFamilySemiBold and PhoneFontSizeMedium styles, but the standard ""blank"" page template still uses PhoneTextNormalStyle (which uses the normal font weight and a slightly smaller size) for the page title."
guid	1	smth	These page templates should be updated to use the medium-sized, semibold font by default for the title text.
guid	0	smth	This change would encourage consistency with both the apps built-in to the OS and within an app itself.
guid	1	smth	This should also be fixed in the WP7 SDK (where all page templates, including the Pivot template, still use PhoneTextNormal style for the title).

guid	0	smth	However there is still a 5mm gap at the top of the page (not including the space for the time etc) that is wasteful.
guid	1	smth	Can you get rid of this space to enable more icons to fit to the homescreen?
guid	0	smth	It's so annoying!!

guid	1	smth	It's not exposed by the SDK, please fix it!
guid	1	smth	We need a way to save videos to the camera roll.
guid	0	smth	The leak of a MediaLibrary.SaveVideo method makes third party video apps very uncomfortable for the user.

guid	0	smth	If we can see the current voltage level, we can determine if the phone is plugged in to USB power, or utilizing an induction charger.
guid	0	smth	Certain WP8 phones have wireless or inductive charging, and we need to be able to calculate the efficiency of these chargers.
guid	0	smth	A thick phone case, or simply not centering the phone on the charging plate can result in reduced charging capacity and much longer charging times.
guid	0	smth	"Adding visbility to the battery mAh would then allow battery ""health"" apps, charger comparisons, and inductive charger efficiency (or inneficiency)."
guid	1	smth	For example, allowing the user to view the time it would take to reach full charge on USB vs induction.
guid	1	smth	Please add the capability to view voltage and mAh, or, if possible, another method to check if the device is charging with USB power or wireless power.
guid	1	smth	We need different sound levels...sound level for system, for alarm clock, for music-radio, and different for keyboard.
guid	1	smth	I want to have sounds enabled to keyboard but not at highest level, also i want to listen to radio (throuth the night) and be sure that the next morning the alarm clock will sound as high as possible to wake me up.

guid	0	smth	Reminder api only allows the developer to repeat at least once in a day.
guid	1	smth	"It would be nice to schedule a reminder to repeat at ""X"" hours"
guid	0	smth	Currently it is impossible to pause in in-progress BackgroundTransferRequest.
guid	0	smth	This would be beneficial for apps where multiple downloads may be running at once and the user wants to optimise the order in which they download.
guid	0	smth	The majority of apps I see at the marketplace doesn't have any review's.
guid	0	smth	( I know that thinking up such a system isn't easy, as you would have to think carefully about abuses)
guid	0	smth	There is currently no indication that an application is being featured, it would be nice to receive a email prior to it being featured to indicate what dates / countries it will be featured in.
guid	1	smth	I think that there should be a nice feature were you can be able to slide the status bar down and view all the push notifications that you got but you didn't view, just like android and IOS, but the best part is that it fixes many problems like when people wanted a short cut to turn WiFi on and off and data on and off so that would be a nice feature to have 2.
guid	1	smth	I strongly think that more background color's should be there, like instead of just black and white, have blue, red, green and stuff like that and more accent colors 3.

guid	1	smth	Better people app, I like the people app with the UI and the Facebook, twitter, LinkedIn integration but the thing I would like most is if you made the top thing that said people was a smaller text, it take to much space on the app 7.
guid	1	smth	Make it so the tiles can be see through and the background can be a background image, that would look nice 8.

guid	0	smth	Some especially for mobile useful CSS features like ms-scroll-chaining, snap-points and several others are missing from the phone version of ie10, which cripples the touch experience and requires additional and less smooth js libraries.

guid	0	smth	BB has this as a standard feature out of the box, while 3rd party apps are available under IOS (though not half as good as the BB).
guid	0	smth	This is particularly helpful when activesync has not been enabled.
guid	0	smth	If the information is available from a browser, it should be available to an app.
guid	0	smth	I want to be nice about this one... but, seriously?
guid	0	smth	"Why is it impossible to get the Contact designated by the system as ""Me"", for the purposes of getting ""my"" current Picture?"
guid	0	smth	Why should I have to implement a ContactPicker to make the user choose, or implement the Live SDK and force them to log in, when the phone already knows?
guid	1	smth	I understand the reasoning for not allowing the user to have access to the Mailboxes in the phone, but there should be an API to enumerate through accounts and get their statistics, like the number of unread emails, number of important emails, and the total e-mail count.
guid	0	smth	There are more and more external sensors, not only medical, but all kind of proximity stuff for watches, smart apliances, cars, and innumerable industrial applications that would pen the door to thousands of new apps.
guid	0	smth	As usual Microsoft is late in this too, and so we have to focus development on iOS and android that have the SDK up to date with technology.
guid	0	smth	Only video.
guid	0	smth	We use Microsoft Expression Encoder to do live, smooth streaming, video feeds.
guid	0	smth	I was surprised to find that the, built-in, media player doesn't support the HTML5 video element and live streaming.
guid	0	smth	"<video src=""http://mlmidev.webcastcenter.com/mlm/idev.isml/manifest(format=m3u8-aapl).m3u8""></video> It works on iOS, Android 3+, and Apple computers with Safari."
guid	0	smth	Since this is a Microsoft technology (or, at least, I thought it was), I figured it would work wonderfully on Window Phone 8.
guid	0	smth	I can use a Silverlight player program (BitGravity Player is what I'm currently using), but it requires me to type an address in.
guid	0	smth	It's just one area that I can't recommend Windows Phones to people.
guid	0	smth	I used to be able to recommend Windows Mobile phones, because we used Windows Media Streaming Server and it had Windows Media Player.
guid	0	smth	It's just one area that I can't recommend___ more
guid	0	smth	You can retweet and answer Tweets but You cant favorite
guid	0	smth	The restrictions on the calendar edit/delete are rediculous.
guid	0	smth	Let the user decide if an app should have access to calendar files.
guid	0	smth	This rigid rule makes it impossible to make a functional 3rd party calendar app.
guid	0	smth	Look at how much Week Calendar from Utilitap have improved iOS for several years before they made a better iCalendar app.
guid	0	smth	I had decided to buy a WP8 phone, but aslong as the calendar lacks so many functions, and there is no hope of a better 3rd party app, I will stick with iOS or possibly Android.
guid	0	smth	This is the most important feature lacking in WP8.
guid	0	smth	By far.
guid	0	smth	This is the most important feature lacking in___ more
guid	0	smth	Let battery more efficient,and alarm can work if the phone turned off
guid	0	smth	That last update at the end of Jan 2013 made the touch responsiveness on my Nokia 920 much worse.
guid	0	smth	the phone jumps to other pages when I am scrolling up and down.
guid	1	smth	Wish I can undo that patch.
guid	0	smth	This would open the way for developers to create applications that will allow users to add unique colors to customize their device.
guid	0	smth	This is not about just having more colors in the them colors dialog, but being able, as a developer.
guid	0	smth	to add more colors to that list from your app.
guid	0	smth	Windows Phone 8 includes a new Map control.
guid	0	smth	It has a new feature to add a route that will be displayed under street names.
guid	0	smth	Street names over the route will be shown in another color and are moved to stay always in center.
guid	0	smth	To add a route to the map you have to create MapRoute object that accepts only Route object in it's constructor.
guid	0	smth	But Route object does not have public constructor.
guid	0	smth	The only possibility to create Route is RouteQuery class.
guid	0	smth	This is a problem!
guid	0	smth	RouteQuery uses online service to calculate the route.
guid	0	smth	Apps can't show the traveled route at real time on the map (like jogging apps).
guid	0	smth	Because they would have to be always online and query the online service frequently.
guid	0	smth	It is possible to workaround this with MapPolyline.
guid	0	smth	But the polyline is shown OVER the street names.
guid	0	smth	Street names color stays black and not being centered.
guid	1	smth	Also if the new Map has route feature it should be usable.
guid	0	smth	Possible solution: Route class implements IRoutePath.
guid	0	smth	MapRoute constructor should accept IRoutePath inteface instead of Route class.
guid	0	smth	Apps can't show the traveled route at___ more
guid	0	smth	The Contact class is missing at least one data point, the Anniversary.
guid	1	smth	Please make sure that any data accessible from the Contact Details page is made available to the Contact class.
guid	0	smth	Other folder continues to grow till phone storage is full.
guid	0	smth	Now uninstalling apps also is not of much use....a reset needs to be done.
guid	0	smth	When Skype replaces Messenger, don't forget wp7 users...background push messaging
guid	1	smth	Improve its data base and functionality.
guid	1	smth	Market it more as a visual assistant.
guid	0	smth	Ex if you see a poster of a movie you want to see.
guid	1	smth	Scan it and Bing Vision give u a list of the nearest theatres and show times, or post a reminder in your calendar.
guid	0	smth	You see a ad for a pair a shoe you want.
guid	1	smth	Scan it and Bing Vision give you a list of the nearest store that have them in stock.
guid	1	smth	As the current time sync does not work correctly (at least in The Netherlands) i want the option to build my own.
guid	1	smth	Allow Zune music + video tile in windows phone 7 to fetch metadata and display artist images and artist names in India too ... settings>applications >lock+wallpaper >show artist image when playing music under lock screen ....
guid	0	smth	This option is also not work until we have metadata of song i.e.
guid	0	smth	artist image ....
guid	1	smth	Please make it available .. As it also makes the Zune tile live
guid	0	smth	The Windows RT simulator lets you emulate multitouch interaction by exploiting the use of the mouse wheel.
guid	1	smth	It would be very helpful the same functionality also in the Windows Phone emulator.
guid	1	smth	Add an option for remove the image in a contact.
guid	0	smth	Big lack.
guid	0	smth	You can add an image but you cant remove it.
guid	0	smth	Allow close the task on long press right Button in Phone.
guid	0	smth	Windows Phone 8 may have 3 new resolutions, but it only actually has two aspect ratios, 150% scaling and 160% scaling (accessible through App.Current.Host.Content.ScaleFactor).
guid	0	smth	Because WVGA and WXGA are the same aspect ratio, and because the website is a giant PITA in uploading images, you have to take and submit 3 screenshots per actual screenshot per language.
guid	0	smth	4 screenshots in two languages turns into 24 screenshots, which is totally nuts.
guid	1	smth	If you guys employed a .NET module like imageresizing.net on your hosting clusters, you could reduce it to 2 screenshots per actual screenshot per language by only submitting WXGA and 720P images, and then autoscaling the WXGA images down to WVGA through an image handler.
guid	0	smth	That would significantly reduce the amount of effort a developer has to go through to publish an app.
guid	1	smth	If you guys employed a .NET module like imageresizing.net on your hosting clusters, you could reduce it to 2 screenshots per actual screenshot per language by only submitting WXGA and___ more
guid	1	smth	Add support for Office to directly send presentation to wireless projector.
guid	0	smth	I have a valid phone, with it's own Microsoft Account I have a valid developer account (with another ID) I start up the Windows Phone Registration app, and no matter which of the two above entities I enter, I keep on getting the pesky error 'Device not registered with Marketplace.
guid	1	smth	Please return to the Windows Phone Dev Center for more information (0x80043001)' message.
guid	0	smth	What's going on here ?
guid	1	smth	I would like the option to schedule my mail synchronization.
guid	0	smth	So, like from 9:00 to17:00 my businesses mail should be synchronized on arrival, but after business hours every hour or not at all.
guid	0	smth	Hi, I am developing an app that play remote MP4 file via Internet using MediaElement.
guid	0	smth	This app has no issue on Windows Phone 7.5.
guid	0	smth	But on both Windows Phone 8 emulator and device (Nokia Lumia 920), there are 2 problems: - DownloadProgress property often returned 1.0 right after video if opened.
guid	0	smth	Video size is ~1GB so it must take long time to get 1.0 value.
guid	0	smth	This problem happens randomly.
guid	0	smth	We can see the issue by playing youtube video or play video in MetroTube, Tube Pro app.
guid	0	smth	- Sometimes when I seek the video by changing Position property, I've got a trouble with infinite loop of buffering and video never play again.
guid	0	smth	I had to re-open video and change the Position property again and sometimes this problem is disappeared.
guid	0	smth	Please see the log text below to understand circumstance.
guid	0	smth	This problem also happen randomly.
guid	0	smth	One more issue, seeking and opening video time in Windows Phone are quite long in comparison with iOS.
guid	0	smth	I tried to play the same remote video via WIFI and iPhone 4 always win Nokia Lumia 920.
guid	0	smth	Is there any plan to fix it for next OS Update ?

guid	0	smth	Hi, As we know, there is a lot of limitations is WP8 OS due the high security in the OS itself which is very good, but some time we need to allow some apps to do extra works, apps which we trust i.e: hotmail app, facebook app, skype app ....
guid	1	smth	It will be a good idea if you introduce a Trust Center OR maybe Trusted Apps, which requires more review form Microsoft before publishing maybe.
guid	0	smth	The idea is that we can develop a regular app and we request our permissions in the manifest, OR the app can ASK FOR TRUST so if the user agrees the app will be shown in the trusted app center in the settings with its extra permissions requested.
guid	0	smth	As an Example for the Trusted App Center Settings: * MyOwnEmailClient APP Permission Requested: * Send Email (Without user intervention) * Send SMS (without user intervention) * Manage Contacts (read/write) * ... and so on.

guid	0	smth	It simply doesn't work.
guid	0	smth	In order to take the screenshot it takes 2 mouse clicks and about half a second.
guid	0	smth	If I am lucky I can do it before my character dies, even then though the player is just moving in a straight line to nowhere by the time I actually take the screenshot.

guid	0	smth	I am concerned however that Microsoft are not pushing enough for access to successful top selling apps, which are popular on the Iphone and Android platforms e.g.

guid	0	smth	Maybe the normal screen timeout would apply here as well, rather than the lock screen timeout.

guid	0	smth	Not really sure where to put this, so i'm going to ask here.
guid	0	smth	I really really loved the Now Playing Screen on the Zune HD (Like the current Zune Software) with information and stuff moving over the artist background, which panned.
guid	0	smth	Is there any way Microsoft could integrate this into the next version of Windows Phone?

guid	0	smth	At the moment there's no way for an app to know if its primary live tile is visible or not.
guid	0	smth	Although the Native Screenshot feature is reported to not be available until Windows Phone 8, I have some concerns regarding this feature that may impact Windows Phone 7 apps as well.
guid	0	smth	Since this issue will impact my decisions when developing my Windows Phone 7 app, I do not consider this off topic.
guid	0	smth	I am concerned whether we will be able to opt out or disable the feature within our apps.
guid	0	smth	I am concerned about security and DRM issues.
guid	0	smth	Will Microsoft provide an API that will allow us to: 1.

guid	0	smth	That folder would be available for all apps.
guid	0	smth	Currently I know of developers creating deep link tiles from XAML in their application, so the idea isn't too far off.
guid	0	smth	This came up while talking to other developers at a few talks/meetups (not because I created the largest vector based creative commons icon pack for Windows Phone that many of you use already).
guid	0	smth	Currently I know of developers creating___ more
guid	0	smth	In short, now that we can have multiple tiles, sure, it's great that they can open the app.
guid	0	smth	But why not let us flip the tile instead (Note: The mail tile would *always* open the app.)
guid	0	smth	Think of a 'Stocks' app where you see the price and change on the front, then tapping it shows the graph on the back.
guid	0	smth	Perhaps a double-tap opens the app like they do now.
guid	0	smth	Social networking APIs, like Facebook, are constantly adding new features.
guid	0	smth	Proving access to the authentication directly (even if it were temporary) would allow applications to use the most up-to-date social networking SDK to provide better features for their users.

guid	0	smth	The current developer ecosystem for WindowsPhone apps is focused on individual developers or corporate developer accounts that typically distribute apps to the masses via the Marketplace.
guid	0	smth	"Internal use of apps is defined as a ""beta test"" and requires a list of Live IDs designated to allow a certain set of users to download and use the app."
guid	0	smth	Ideally, a company may wish to dedicate a group of Live IDs as testers to be used each time.
guid	0	smth	For this cost, a company would receive two unlocked WindowsPhone devices that could be traded or upgraded.
guid	0	smth	This allows a team to use these devices for testing, as opposed to having to put company apps on their personal devices or hand their devices over for demonstrations.
guid	0	smth	The Enterprise account would also allow for distribution of apps at the organizational level - either in-house or to clients.
guid	0	smth	It could also allow for a specific download key if purchases were made outside of the app Marketplace.
guid	0	smth	Together, this level of support would cater to a market that would like to leverage the Marketplace in a unique way while having the tools and capabilities to develop apps without requirements of personal accounts or devices.

guid	0	smth	When I type a text message and need to go back to a different app (to copy a phone number to paste into the text message for example), I lose what I have typed when I come back to the text message editor, which is very frustrating.
guid	0	smth	Can this be possible on the phone.
guid	0	smth	"It will allow ""code anywhere anytime on windows"" idea."
guid	0	smth	When you create a tile dynamically, it is common to want to save it as a Png file so that it uses transparency (so that it respects the theme accent color).
guid	0	smth	However, there is no built in method to save a WriteableBitmap as a png.
guid	0	smth	There is however a nice extension to save it to jpg, but that doesn't help if you want to use transparency to leverage the theme accent color in your tile.
guid	0	smth	I think many apps that need to generate a tile dynamically will encounter this issue.
guid	0	smth	For instance, if I build a children's book app and then submit that same app 50 times, each time with a different name and book loaded, i have essentially used up all the available space on the marketplace app search results screen, thereby stifling competition and innovation through use of questionable practices and a bad app design.
guid	0	smth	"All subsequent children's book apps will be essentially ""undiscoverable"" no matter how good they are... Start by expanding the number of apps that can use a certain key word, such as ""childrens stories"" so that new apps who innovate can displace those who got their first with potentially crappy apps."

guid	0	smth	I am using a open source API called OpenStack Storage (http://openstack.org/projects/storage/) that requires passing empty headers to remove certain custom metadata entries.
guid	0	smth	The library being used by WP (HttpWebRequest) doesn't allow passing empty headers.
guid	0	smth	It is unacceptable simply because according to RFC 2616 Section 4.1 (Header Field Definitions), the message headers of an HTTP 1.1 message value is optional.
guid	0	smth	This is limiting me to provide customers to fully use my app for stuff like removing entries on their objects.

guid	0	smth	Windows Phone breaks from iOS and Android by removing the need to open an app to share pictures and statuses by adding a sharing API.
guid	1	smth	However, this must be updated by Microsoft.
guid	0	smth	These services would be in charge of running the API and posting the data and could take the form of an implementable interface such as a ILinkSharer or something similar allowing the windows phone sharing interface to constantly expand and become dynamic, tailored to the users needs while removing the requirement for Microsoft to make the updates (As the Zune attempted to do with it's apps, a bad idea).

guid	0	smth	As app developers we are currently stuck with 2 methods of generating revenues 1) one time app payment 2) Ads.
guid	0	smth	This would mean we could make ad free apps that developers are motivated to keep adding features to over time since they are generating ongoing revenues.

guid	0	smth	In trying to develop a custom playlist application, it is apparent that it is impossible to integrate the BackgroudAudioPlayer with the XNA.MediaLibrary.
guid	0	smth	This means that applications that wish to use the capabilities of the BackgroundAgent are restricted to using only local audio files that are deployed with teh application, or audio streaming sources.
guid	0	smth	There is no way to access the phone's MediaLibray.Songs to have the BAP play these files in teh background.
guid	0	smth	This is highly restrictive because we can only use the MediaPlayer for foreground applications.
guid	0	smth	Unless of course we go with a predetermined SongCollection such as SongCollection limitedPlaylist = new MediaLibrary.Songs; This stops the ability to create custom playlists.
guid	0	smth	There are really a number of ways MS could address this limitation: 1.
guid	0	smth	This way we can pass the entire SongCollection object to the MediaPlayer.Play() method, and providing we don't stop the MediaPlayer, the entire playlist will continue to play despite other foreground applications running.
guid	0	smth	So long as the user must explicitally accept the use of teh app in the background, then why is it an issue.
guid	0	smth	Users understand the additional strain this would potentially put on battery life, but by accepting they agree that it's okay.

Change it to a localizable mechanism please

guid	0	smth	According to the description the Pushpin object should work as pop-up information window activated by pressing the map icon.
guid	0	smth	Now it doesn't work the same way.
guid	1	smth	Looks like it's functionality should be corrected.
guid	1	smth	The emulator should include a treeview control to display a live view of: Page States App State IsolatedStorageSettings IsolatedStorageFile(s) The ideal would include some kind of object drill down in the style of Mole for WPF, but even ToStrings would work.
guid	0	smth	This combined with file drag drop from Windows Explorer would make app life cycle debugging a lot simpler.
guid	0	smth	Today, when users click a link in IE, most of the times you would get a message that this content type is not supported on phone.
guid	0	smth	Altough there are app like office, acrobet reader and many 3rd party apps which handles the particular content-type.
guid	1	smth	We need to have a way by which applications can register the type of content they handle so that when user is downloading a content using IE, they can choose installed application to open with.
guid	0	smth	Today application are achieving this by embedding browser control which is not a good expereince for end user.

guid	0	smth	The same could be implemented in the Windows Phone so that developer can use it hassle free.

guid	0	smth	Once access to a user___s podcast subscriptions and already downloaded episodes is enabled, developers may easily write applications which enhance the existing playback experience.

guid	0	smth	Some RITs that ARE comms intensive might use the mobile carrier anyway at user discretion.

guid	0	smth	SSDP (used in UPnP) relies on UDP multicast for discovery.
guid	0	smth	Currently UdpAnySourceMulticastClient allows for the listening to existing SSDP traffic, as well as sending a solicitation (M-SEARCH) out requesting that UPnP devices advertise themselves to the solicitor.
guid	0	smth	When a device replies to the M-SEARCH message it sends a unicast message to the IP & port that the M-SEARCH message was sent from.
guid	0	smth	There is no way for a WP7 application using UdpAnySourceMulticastClient or Socket to listen on the correct port, thus requiring a great deal of time to be spent in any UPnP application when doing device discovery.

guid	0	smth	Other implementations of SQL CE already support full-text indexes (i.e.

guid	0	smth	In NoDo the user could leave the app switch the theme (i.e.

guid	0	smth	In Mango the user's faced with an unholy mess because the app is only informed of the system's theme state at start-up.
guid	0	smth	Developers have the choice of looking incompetent or ruthlessly picking a theme & sticking to it, thus rendering the ability to choose an overall theme pointless.
guid	0	smth	The SmsComposeTask does not provide any events.

guid	0	smth	We've still useless applications flooding the Marketplace, and there are no signs of it slowing.
guid	1	smth	I believe that, instead of limiting the amount of certifications per user per day, the Marketplace should be a little better curated.
guid	1	smth	Spam applications should not be approved.
guid	1	smth	They should never pass certification, and should never be published.
guid	1	smth	Bulk publishers should be made to consolidate their apps, and the rest should not pass.
guid	0	smth	They should___ more
guid	0	smth	I thought I had raised this as a platform request, but seems it's showing up in Feature Feedback instead.
guid	0	smth	Multiline text input in the current version of the platform is usable if you can work out how (or be told how) to do it, however it's not very intuitive and I'm concerned for apps that have this as a substantial feature the experience for consumers is not what it could be.
guid	0	smth	"Current Capability for Multiline Navigation via TextBox -------------------------------------------------------------------- The way it currently works is if you tap and hold, you get the ""I"" cursor to appear."
guid	0	smth	If you entered long lines of text that take up the width of the TextBox then you will likely instinctively find you can scroll up and down through the text by dragging the cursor above and below the TextBox.
guid	0	smth	"However, if you entered shorter lines, you will find that this dragging action does not work until such time as the ""I"" cursor makes contact with some text."
guid	0	smth	"You will see it visually ""lock in"" to the text when this happens."
guid	0	smth	I believe this will confuse users and create unecessary friction for consumers to make use of apps that depend on multiline input that potentially is longer than displayed in half (allowing for the SIP) a portrait or landscape screen.
guid	0	smth	What Would Improve Usability?
guid	0	smth	Swipe gesture to control vertical scrolling when vertical scrollbar is auto/visible (latter is currently ignored).
guid	1	smth	If using tap/hold, allow vertical scrolling without locking into text as described above.
guid	0	smth	Alternatively ---------------- To provide an experience consistent with the platforms SMS text input capability, provide support to allow TextBox to 1. grow as new lines are added.
guid	0	smth	2. be placed in a ScrollViewer and have the viewport follow newlines as they are added.
guid	0	smth	Thanks for considering.
guid	0	smth	Link to related App Hub suggestion: http://forums.create.msdn.com/forums/p/74377/453077.aspx#453077 Link to related Connect Issue: https://connect.microsoft.com/VisualStudio/feedback/details/641068/multiline-text-input-on-windows-phone I thought I had raised this as a platform request, but seems it's showing up in Feature Feedback instead.
guid	0	smth	If you entered___ more
guid	1	smth	when playing a video from an HTML5 video tag the player should allow the user to drag the progress bar to seek ahead in the video.
guid	1	smth	I would like to write Business Applications that get started when the phone is turned on and have as much control as a running app.. An idea would be having the phone snap pictures periodically and then uploading them..
guid	0	smth	There is currently no way to know if an EmailComposeTask was cancelled or got an error while sending.
guid	1	smth	I need to be able to tell if the user actually went through with the email to know whether to delete the email text.
guid	0	smth	Otherwise I have to ask the user if they sent it (poor user experience).
guid	1	smth	For those of us wanting to provide free applications it would be nice if the WP7 supported self signed certs or the very least a widely known free SSL authority.
guid	1	smth	Add ServicePointManager.
guid	1	smth	Or at the very least add a free service to your accepted list of SSL authorities.
guid	0	smth	Like cacert.org for instance.
guid	1	smth	I would like to see an agent like the scheduled task one that can be executed on a specific date and time.
guid	0	smth	Think of an app that needs to update the tile once a year or month to remind the user of something.
guid	0	smth	Currently this is not possible because the agents are disabled after 15 days if the application is not opened.
guid	0	smth	App-specific launchers: instead of opening a site's web page, check whether a compatible app is installed or registered.
guid	0	smth	To support things like midroll video advertisments, multiple MediaElements are needed.
guid	0	smth	This is supported in Silverlight for the web.
guid	0	smth	it would be helpfull to have a passwordBox like control which supports Number only keyboard.
guid	0	smth	Numeric only passwords makes more sense for Smartphone world as its fast, convenient and easy to type.
guid	0	smth	private/corporate WiFi authentication with a certificate is not supported at Mango.
guid	0	smth	This could allow for quite a few scenarios - someone is currently locked in with a carrier that doesn't have WP7 phones available.
guid	0	smth	They could actually purchase apps on the Marketplace and use them.
guid	0	smth	"Enable a ""code-once"" and runs on Windows or Phone."
guid	1	smth	It would be good to have a Video Chooser Task that works in the same way as the PhotoChooserTask.
guid	0	smth	The reason for this is for users to be able to do things like apply filters, add audio tracks, crop out a relevant section, etc... of a recorded video and saving it back to the MediaLibrary.
guid	0	smth	I assume saving to the MediaLibrary will be part of the AR functionality in mango anyway?
guid	0	smth	This will benefit for applications which create audio, or recording voice, it will be easy and unified way to export audio files instead of create extra server program.
guid	1	smth	Cursor arrow keys are needed on the virtual keyboard.
guid	0	smth	Using touch to position the cursor is a good start, but it's clumsy and easily off by one character, which would be acceptable if there were at least a left arrow key in addition to backspace.
guid	0	smth	Perhaps at least press+hold on backspace to bring up an arrows menu.
guid	0	smth	Besides myself, is there any interest in adding this capability?
guid	0	smth	There are many places where apps will not connect to a cell tower [e.g.
guid	0	smth	in a general aviation (or commercial) aircraft where cell phones do not work well [it is illegal to use in any case] and also in isolated rural areas.
guid	0	smth	And finally memory is very cheap.
guid	0	smth	Some suggest that large images (even broken into tiles) are inappropriate for storage on a phone ___ that is ridiculous!
guid	1	smth	Local MultiScaleImage functionality is available on iPhone so please do not put WP7 developers at a disadvantage.
guid	0	smth	If a user wants to pan around a large image what difference does it make to the form factor whether it is local or online - none!
guid	1	smth	Please get this component opened up for isolated storage use in the near future.
guid	0	smth	The implementation of the SQL Compact was a pretty steap learning curve for me as i was used to the .net GUI Implementation that made it very easy to use.
guid	1	smth	I think there needs to be more focus on making it easier and quicker to implement these plumbing features as a lot of developers will be hobbyist and do not contain the time and knowledge required to implement of lot of these plumbing features.
guid	1	smth	Please make it quick and simple for us to get our ideas out there.
guid	1	smth	Detailed customization should be an after thought for us
guid	1	smth	Allow apps with the interop capabilty flag in the manifest, perhaps via custom certificate, like Microsoft Office Digital Certificate for VBA Projects.
guid	0	smth	These are valid only on the device on which they were created, so the only phone you'd brick would be your dev-unlocked own.
guid	1	smth	OK, I realize that this is dependent on the carrier, but WP7 needs to support it if the carrier can offer it.
guid	0	smth	Somebody correct me if I'm way off base.
guid	0	smth	Please let me know how to do this?
guid	0	smth	Both on my iOS and Droid I can use my work email exchange server.
guid	0	smth	However the webbased certificate is not signed by a trusted member and was always allowed to okay it with those OSes.
guid	0	smth	WP7 will only let me use exchange with registered and installed certificates and will not let me bypass if I know it is okay.
guid	0	smth	Ability to display street side and birds eye view from bing map control.
guid	0	smth	When you update an app and update the App tile icon and/or Background image, save the update as it is not working
guid	0	smth	Imagine if you are calling someone who is already involved in a call, the waiting notification displayed which has been available for long time in several mobiles could give you a relief to contact him later instead of doing a recurring calling and bothering him/her.
guid	0	smth	This is a missing feature since windows mobile.
guid	0	smth	Do you agree that it is time to have it now?
guid	1	smth	Add a tile view like in old Windows 8.1 Store.
guid	1	smth	Enable recording of FM radio.
guid	0	smth	Currently in Mango these is a soft search button in the GUI displayed for context sensitive search.
guid	0	smth	The hardware button seems to always pull up a Bing!
guid	0	smth	Surely the design ideology was that the hardware search button was context sensitive.
guid	1	smth	If so then the soft search button is not needed and can be removed from being displayed if a hardware button is available.
guid	0	smth	This would free up more screen real estate especially as many application bars only have a soft search button on them anyway.
guid	0	smth	In order to display more details on network connection, and to distinguish WiFi networks connected to.
guid	1	smth	Allow filtering of marketplace results within categories beyond pay/free/top/new by adding filter by rating (ex: 4+), by price (ex: <$1.99), by number of downloads (ex: 10000+), or allow blacklisting of developers (or developer rankings) so spam apps and spam devs could be avoided.
guid	1	smth	Enable FM scan function in the developer API.
guid	0	smth	I notice it is already available to the user in the 7.1 version (Mango) but I don't see methods in the API for scanning to the next signal (or seeking, whatever the term is called).
guid	1	smth	Allow apps to be hidden/visible in the store without having to go through the whole update process.
guid	0	smth	Back to how it was on the old dashboard would be ideal, just a simple link to toggle between visible and hidden.
guid	0	smth	Handy for if you have to take the back end server offline so new users can't download your app and instantly think the app is useless
guid	0	smth	In the new store is not possible to delete an existing app from the store(or if exist, it is really well hidden).
guid	0	smth	In addiction if you try delete an app name, you can also confirm your operation but the name doesn't get deleted and stay reserved for the app..
guid	0	smth	I can't see the total downloads of my apps anymore, because the downloads prior to the new dashboard has vanished.
guid	0	smth	Currently we need to do some trickery to take screenshots of application that use panorama control.
guid	0	smth	But if we try to save an Image within app inside Media library or some Isolated storage we can't prserve exif info of that image.
guid	0	smth	Read the given link for more details: http://forums.create.msdn.com/forums/p/84673/510718.aspx#510718
guid	0	smth	When you use the DefaultItem property of the Panorama control, it's as if you're just rearranging the items.
guid	0	smth	I use this property to restore application state after tombstoning, but the user experience is terrible because this just causes the pano items to reorder themselves.
guid	0	smth	The correct behavior would be if the panorama were to immediately scroll to the default page (whether animated or not)
guid	0	smth	The old developer dashboard allowed me to remove apps that I no longer want to be published.
guid	0	smth	I can't do this in the new developer center for apps that have passed certification and are published in the store
guid	0	smth	The keywords people use in unsuccessful marketplace searches (particularly in the desktop Zune application) would, if ranked by frequency, provide useful information to developers on where to focus their development efforts.
guid	0	smth	This would create more opportunities for developers while also helping to provide customers with the apps they want.
guid	0	smth	Needed to create pro level sequencers, synths and music creation related apps!
guid	0	smth	If I want to update a Live Tile from my own App I can't draw it's background image on the phone, because if I store it to IsolatedStorage i'm not able to get an URI for it which I could provide the StandardTileData-Object with.
guid	0	smth	"If there were an ""Extras"" menu option in IE where 3rd party apps could be plugged in, it would be possible to pass perhaps the URL of the currently selected site onto apps that could add value - for instance, by giving the option to subscribe to an RSS or Atom feed where present."
guid	0	smth	When developing with the phone connected via USB, having the screen lock itself is very annoying, and makes app deployment fail.
guid	0	smth	"Some WP7 phone (not the AT&T Samsung Focus) have a ""never"" screen timeout."
guid	0	smth	However this is for battery and powered scenarios, and you don't want to be manually switching it back and forth all the time.
guid	0	smth	Some of us are stuck with a phone that locks itself all the time.
guid	0	smth	The screen lock also interrupts or prevents app deployment.
guid	0	smth	This makes Visual Studio fail to start the debugging session.
guid	1	smth	An app deployment should unlock the screen and reset the lock timer to zero.
guid	0	smth	An app deployment should unlock the screen and reset the___ more
guid	1	smth	We need a beta store for windows 10 apps for selected internal testers only.
guid	1	smth	Copy from Android and add beta and alpha store too!
guid	0	smth	Do not complain if developers prefer other platforms: you don't make us life easy at all!!
guid	0	smth	Currently you can assign to ApplicationBarIconButton an icon present on your project as 'content'.
guid	0	smth	This basically means you have to determine your icons at design time.
guid	0	smth	By providing the ability to assign an icon placed on the IsolatedStorage, the developer will be free to create button icons at runtime, dynamically download them from other places etc.
guid	0	smth	There is no such option to delete the beta app from dashboard.
guid	1	smth	Even there should be a option to delete the MPNS certificate .
guid	0	smth	I don't believe that there is not ADO.NET!
guid	0	smth	No SQL queries to run.
guid	0	smth	Must redo all applications from Windows Mobile/MonoTouch/MonoDroid/WPF for WP7.
guid	0	smth	I have the same core code running on the above platforms but to do it on WP7.1 I will have to rewrite!
guid	0	smth	Unacceptable.
guid	0	smth	Adding new test users without new submission.
guid	1	smth	Posibility to add new test users in real-time mode.
guid	0	smth	It will be more quickly and easier.
guid	1	smth	Give ability to create games that have access for xbox live achievements.
guid	0	smth	It doesn't have to be full access.
guid	0	smth	"Still only partners can have a ""Xbox live"" mark on their game icon, but having a one place for achievements, leader boards and friends would be great (WP7 Live?)"
guid	0	smth	Some people have had other developers submit apps to the marketplace on their behalf for many reason.
guid	0	smth	They may have been in a country that is not supported for example.
guid	0	smth	More then one developer may have worked on the app and are now splitting.
guid	0	smth	Some people may sell their apps to others.
guid	0	smth	In all these cases it breaks the update cycle for existing users because the new owner would have to create a new app instead of updating the existing one.
guid	0	smth	"When I create a paid app with a trial option, many users blow right by it because it doesn't show up in the ""free"" category even though a light version of the app is free (via the trial)."
guid	0	smth	"Some people are resorting to the super-inefficient Apple app store method of releasing 2 versions of the app... one that shows up in the ""free"" category and another that runs as a paid app."
guid	0	smth	"The ""trial"" is a fantastic concept, but it is hobbled by this oversight"
guid	1	smth	Add ADO.NET to the Silverlight .Net framework so you can use DataSets when working with XML and Relational Data via C# in Windows Phone 7.
guid	0	smth	Right now there is no way to sync anything but pictures generated on the phone to the user's PC.
guid	0	smth	"If I create a word processor style application or something of the sort, I have to start integrating with this service or that service on the ""cloud"" to get it off the user's device."
guid	0	smth	None of my customers understand why they cant just connect the phone to thier PCs and the files are automatically sync'ed to a folder dedicated for this.
guid	0	smth	It is especially wierd since they can sync pictures and music.
guid	0	smth	It is especially wierd since they can sync pictures___ more
guid	1	smth	I need to write to a bitmap which is very painful (imagine a vnc client for example) on windows phone right now, so please support the Copy- and WritePixels methods and some others.
guid	1	smth	I would like to have one overview with all reviews for all apps.
guid	0	smth	If you have many apps like me (about 40) it takes a lot of time.
guid	1	smth	Maybe you can add an 'All Apps' option to the 'Page filter' of the reviews.
guid	0	smth	Dear Team Support, I was uploading games in windows phone store, but from last Friday there seems to be some kind of bug in your windows phone store.
guid	0	smth	I have created one new app and reserved it's name on that called fightofthelenegs, but when I try to create app packages, it is not showing in the package list in visual studio!!
guid	0	smth	I am unable to understand the reason!!
guid	0	smth	Please do help me on this so that I can upload another new game in the store itself.
guid	0	smth	I am using Visuall Studio 2013.
guid	0	smth	Updating an app listing that supports multiple languages is one of the most painful experiences when developing for Windows.
guid	1	smth	"Why can we not just have a ""store manifest"" that includes all localized descriptions, screenshots, etc."
guid	0	smth	which will be detected when we upload the app via the dashboard.
guid	0	smth	It would allow us to skip all that crazy input in 32 different languages, just to (for example) swap out one screenshot.
guid	1	smth	Alternatively: provide an API for the submission process so we can at least somewhat alleviate the pain ourselves.
guid	0	smth	It would be a great way to better integrate applications if there was a sports & news hub.
guid	1	smth	I imagine the default setup could simply default to news and sports from MSN (or one of MS' other affiliates) then allow RSS feeds to be added.
guid	1	smth	Enhance that further by allowing 3rd party application tie-ins, like ESPN's app or news from a BBC or CNN application.
guid	1	smth	MS' could even add features like they have in Media Center for Sports such as a ticker feed and Fantasy player tracking.
guid	0	smth	Support Windows Server 2008 R2
guid	1	smth	Controls displaying the SIP when focused should provide a method to close the SIP to ensure data binding is applied.
guid	0	smth	"Currently if the user clicks the ""save"" button right after using the SIP, the data entered is not persisted to the object bound to the control."
guid	0	smth	Is it possible to put something like Microsoft.WindowsMobile.status on the development of your Windows phone 7.1?
guid	0	smth	Purpose: Events related to: When one phone call starts and ends.
guid	0	smth	also something for SMS.
guid	0	smth	This is for perform any action on background!
guid	1	smth	Allow developers to use an in-built API to compress videos captured from the camera, using either H264, or MPEG-4.
guid	0	smth	Sometimes it's usefull to explore and tranfer back files generated in app that's running on phone/emulator back to the developer PC, without additional coding.
guid	1	smth	Remove the 10 recipient cap on App generated SMS messages.
guid	0	smth	Obviously this is in place to ensure people do not spend lots of money if they don't have unlimited bundles.
guid	0	smth	"However a simple message box saying ""This message is going to be sent to 36 people, are you sure you want to send"" would be sufficient."
guid	0	smth	This System for featuresuggestion is good, but I miss the feedback to the feedback.
guid	0	smth	At the moment only one idea is marked as planed.
guid	0	smth	Even some of the ideas will ship in the next Update they haven't marked as planed or startet.
guid	0	smth	Which would give the people that use this Platform give a positive feedback and get there Votes back without manualy search for votes they no longer need because it will be provided in the next Update
guid	0	smth	The company for I works loose a project because one of the client's requirements is change the Windows Wallpaper, ringtones and other features that are no disponible in Windows Phone 7.
guid	0	smth	The project will be developed in Andriod.
guid	0	smth	Currently it is VERY TEDIOUS and takes HOURS to submit an app update, especially when you have multiple app packages, and lots of languages.
guid	0	smth	You have to manually use the website to change descriptions, switch languages, lots of copy and paste, remove each screenshot, put a new screenshot.
guid	0	smth	It literally takes hours, and it drives you crazy.
guid	0	smth	Instead we could get everything ready locally and do a push and upload it all quickly.
guid	0	smth	Currently apps are executed in sandboxes and there's no way to apps can work together.
guid	0	smth	one app to look up information in the internet opens up another app that can scan barcodes..
guid	0	smth	The same is true for applications and the OS itself.
guid	1	smth	Some kind of handlers on context menus of certain objects would be great.
guid	0	smth	the context menu of images could list tasks provided by apps dealing with images.
guid	0	smth	In more detailed/extremely simplified: What about having an app that rotates an image, an app that uploads images into the web and an app that is capable to send an image to the nearest printer.
guid	0	smth	In more detailed/extremely simplified: What about having an app that rotates an image, an app that uploads images into the web and an app that is capable to send___ more
guid	0	smth	i dont want use UAC, is a security risk.
guid	0	smth	but i want have metro apps
guid	0	smth	Application developers currently (pre-Mango) have no facilities to access the c contents of an incoming SMS message.
guid	1	smth	It would be great if applications could register for such a capability thus enabling scenarios such as SMS challenge authentication.
guid	1	smth	Add Ability to set referrer and other custom headers when using HttpWebRequest
guid	0	smth	My company likes WP7, but the nonexistence of visual voice-mail is stopping a switch from the iPhone.
guid	0	smth	Is there a way to access voice-mail metadata?
guid	1	smth	Distribute more application bar icons in SDK (at least each one used by built-in applications); provide forum/marketplace for other artwork, including control templates & styles.
guid	1	smth	Increase webbrowser control function
guid	0	smth	Google has playbooks and apple has ibooks for better reading of eBooks and there are many third party applications which make easy reading of ebooks but none of theme have inbuilt dictionary and they lack in many features in terms of user experience.
guid	0	smth	I understand the max size limitation to control.
guid	0	smth	And there are some approach to work around on most of the controls.
guid	0	smth	However, for some control, e.g.
guid	0	smth	TextBox, it's a big problem.
guid	0	smth	Socket APIs and duplex WCF communication
guid	0	smth	Currently it's not possoble to make connections behind proxy servers that require authentication.
guid	0	smth	This very much limits business type apps that can use resources or run apps while connected to a work network.
guid	0	smth	It's only currently possible via the web browser.
guid	1	smth	support chinese
guid	1	smth	Allow developers to alter/edit an applications metadata, including description, images/graphics, pricing and keywords etc... once the app is published without resubmitting.
guid	0	smth	This would make bug fixes to spelling and screeshots simple & would save Microsoft from having to test submissions for Metadata only.
guid	0	smth	Maybe sending a zip.
guid	0	smth	System supported application error reporting service, that would report back to developers application crashes and details.
guid	1	smth	I wish I could simulate multitouch on the emulator (ie: Pinch and zoom) with 2 mice.
guid	1	smth	"Just like the picture extras ... it'd be great if apps like twitter and facebook could register to be on the list of applications that a user can ""share"" a piece of text with in addition to email and sms."
guid	0	smth	This enables a number of cross app communication scenarios and lets the user choose how he wants to share that info
guid	0	smth	This enables caching of and usage of offline maps
guid	0	smth	Until Windows [Phone] 8.1 this part was too painful and took a lot of time and work.
guid	0	smth	Hope there are some automated tool for taking localised screenshots.
guid	0	smth	Then, I navigate to another page, press the button and it take N screenshots again, one for each language.
guid	0	smth	In the upload website, a way to remove all screenshots and a way to upload all assets for all languages at once.
guid	1	smth	Provide a pre-certification tool that runs all the tests the Marketplace certification tool runs.
guid	0	smth	So developpers can have more confidence it will pass the tests and fix the issues before submitting to the marketplace.
guid	0	smth	Time saver for Developers and Microsoft.
guid	0	smth	The phone currently plays a large selection of media formats (MP4, M4V, 3GP etc) that aren't supported in the emulator.
guid	0	smth	This makes apps that use these formats extremely hard to debug.
guid	0	smth	Would be awesome if you could fix this :)
guid	0	smth	"Just like the picture/music extras to be able to integrate in a persons/phone numbers(unkown caller)) So to add phone services to easy search for numbers or To be able to start a ""contact/message"" app from the contact card."
guid	1	smth	Allow applications to register messaging endpoints on device [e.g.
guid	0	smth	register as a launcher/chooser] to ease on-device inter-application communication
guid	0	smth	When I see the Palm pre's multitask switch, I know there is something MS can do better.
guid	0	smth	Hopefully with fluently switch and creative gesture and UI.
guid	0	smth	Now we can just use pivot and panorama,but we can not handle their sensitive degree,sometimes I feel it's so high,and I want to edit it but no way to do this.
guid	0	smth	Currently only Store apps can be submitted to the Store.
guid	0	smth	With all the new screen sizes and resolutions, testing in the emulator is certainly one way to try them out, but it'd aid in even more rapid development to be able to see them on the design surface like we already have for WVGA, WXGA, and 720p sizes.
guid	0	smth	"We're still missing the 1080p and 6"" sizes"
guid	0	smth	Currently if we logged in twitter/fb or any other social networking sites throug their APIs, we cant logout.
guid	0	smth	It is because the web browser keeps the cookies.
guid	0	smth	So he cant login into his another account.
guid	0	smth	Currently (Windows Phone 8.1) if you store your credentials in the PasswordVault, they aren't deleted on app uninstall, so if you install the app again the last stored credentials are available.
guid	0	smth	I think the credentials needs to be deleted with the app uninstall.
guid	0	smth	Creating a Modern Windows app can require creating a lot of project files, one one per platform type (Windows Phone 8.0, Windows Phone 8.1, Windows 8.0, and Windows 8.1), with each project generating its own, unique output.
guid	0	smth	Even Universal App projects create multiple projects, one for Windows 8.1, another for Windows Phone 8.1 (neither of which support the previous, 8.0 versions of Windows, to note!)
guid	0	smth	On iOS, it's possible to target many versions of the OS (6.0, 6.1, 7.0, 7.1, 8.0, etc.)
guid	0	smth	with a single project file.
guid	0	smth	When the app gets built, it generates a single package that can be distributed to any version of the OS (within developer-set version limitations).
guid	0	smth	When a new version of the OS comes out, it's possible to upgrade the app's project, and still have it's output support older versions of the OS.
guid	0	smth	(Windows 8.0 projects, when updated to Windows 8.1 projects, lose their ability to support Windows 8.0!)
guid	0	smth	Being able to target multiple versions of Windows with a single project, one that, preferably, built a single app package, would be useful.
guid	0	smth	Furthermore, upgrading that project to target the latest version of Windows, shouldn't cause support for the previous version (of the OS) to be lost!
guid	0	smth	iOS developers get this feature, so should Windows developers.
guid	0	smth	When the app gets built, it generates a single package that can be___ more
guid	0	smth	There has been some discussion on the blog post http://blogs.msdn.com/b/dotnet/archive/2015/07/30/universal-windows-apps-in-net.aspx?PageIndex=2#comments for supporting F# in the .

guid	0	smth	There appears to be no way to deploy an app to a Windows 10 Emulator outside of manually doing so in Visual Studio.
guid	0	smth	Without that, we have no means to wrap our own tooling to launch and install built apps to the emulator.
guid	0	smth	The older tooling (AppDeployCmd.exe) would allow us to list the available emulators we could deploy to and deploy to them (though it's support for devices left a lot to be desired).
guid	0	smth	Oddly with Windows 8.1 tooling installed and Windows 10 SDK, we can actually see the list of Windows 10 emulators listed in the AppDeployCmd output (and need to do some post-filtering to separate the 8.1 and 10 emulators).
guid	0	smth	So currently, we can use the 8.1 tooling to get the list of emulators, but if we try to deploy to them they'll start up but app deployment will fail.

guid	0	smth	"In my view, the two main use cases for the Store search can be summarised as follows: 1.As a Windows app consumer, I want to be able to search for apps by name, so that I can find and download the specific app I am looking for."""
guid	1	smth	As a Windows app consumer, I want to be able to search for apps by functionality, so that I can find and download an app that will help me perform the task I want to carry out.
guid	0	smth	An example of the first might be: ______I____ve heard that Wordament is good, so I____ll type ______Wordament____ into the search box so I can download and play it during my commute to work__.
guid	0	smth	An example of the second might be: ______I really enjoy doing crossword puzzles, so I____ll type ______Crosswords____ into the search box so that I can find and download a crossword app that I play during my commute to work__.
guid	0	smth	The Store search heavily favours matching the search term to the app name over matching to the keywords.
guid	0	smth	It would seem that the search algorithm has been developed to optimise results for use case one above at the expense of use case two.
guid	0	smth	In my view, and I can see from the forums and user voice channel that I am not alone in this, the Store search provides a poor customer experience by not catering effectively for use case two.
guid	1	smth	It is my belief that the search algorithm could be improved to cater for use case two without adversely effecting use case one.
guid	0	smth	Intuitively, if a user already knows the name of an app then it is likely that it is already fairly popular, and so would be ranked highly in search results without the algorithm favouring the app name.
guid	0	smth	In addition, app names are quite specific and so searches for 'Facebook' and 'Wordament' should return a narrow set of results compared to searches for generic terms such as 'crosswords'.
guid	0	smth	Conversely, new apps that are not yet popular would be unknown to consumers, and so would only be found when a user browses categories in the Store or searches for apps by functionality as in use case two.

guid	0	smth	Better support for Podcasts; 
guid	0	smth	I use BeyondPod on my Android phone and it supported integration of sorts with Feedly.
guid	1	smth	"My desire is to be able to catch up on podcasts either on my phone or on my desktop such that if I've listened to a podcast completely from either source (i.e. from my browser at home or work or on my cell phone) that the episode would be marked """"listened to"""" (or read) and disappear from the list in Feedly on any of my machines as well as drop off of my BeyondPod list."
guid	1	smth	Ideally if Feedly and BeyondPod could get together and synchronize the position within a podcast would be excellent!
guid	0	smth	That said, as a podcast player, Feedly leaves a lot to be desired.
guid	0	smth	From what I can tell merely starting to play a podcast marks it as read or essentially completely listened to.
guid	0	smth	Furthermore if I am careless and click somewhere else like to read another article, Feedly will stop the playback and go to the place I clicked.
guid	1	smth	It should warn me.
guid	1	smth	Finally a popout player would be nice for the audio/video of podcasts.
guid	0	smth	Chrome extension required too much permission(extension can access: Your data on all websites)
guid	1	smth	Please reduce required permission for chrome extension.
guid	1	smth	work with soundgecko so anything I mark in feedly goes to soundgecko for readout
guid	1	smth	Feedly should let users login through Mozilla Persona or Gravatar, which don't track users.
guid	0	smth	Persona is made by the makers of the Firefox browser and Gravatar is made by WordPress.
guid	0	smth	I would like to change my log in for feedly so that it does not match my google account, which contains other personal data.
guid	0	smth	"How?"""
guid	0	smth	I cba to leave feedly but I want to know what other people are saying and I want to be able to contribute without signing up to anything.
guid	1	smth	If a blog does use disqus the comments should be viewable and a reply able to be added directly from feedly.
guid	1	smth	make App/Extension/Plugin for all browsers with one click to add feed from any website
guid	0	smth	"There are some private blogs on wordpress.com.	"
guid	0	smth	You can subscribe to them in wordpress reader once you have access to them, but you can't use them outside wordpress.
guid	0	smth	When you could connect your feedly to your wordpress.com account, why shouldn't you be able to subscribe to them?
guid	0	smth	I don't know if wordpress has an API for this; 
guid	1	smth	"I guess such a feature would be a big advantage for your service."""
guid	0	smth	Even though I'm logged in to Google in the same browser, and I've already logged in to Feedly with my google account and granted access to use what it wants, it still keeps logging me out then making me go through this process every couple of days - why?
guid	1	smth	I wish as feedly pro user, if I save the feeds in Evernote I want to tag the note, not only the notebook but also the tag of Evernote.
guid	0	smth	The utm_ parameter added to your links breaks them at some sites.
guid	0	smth	Case in point: New York Magazine.
guid	0	smth	Creating a win win situation for readers and content creators.
guid	1	smth	Further thoughts: feedly could develop 'subscription options' for content creators.
guid	0	smth	i.e feedly handles payment and delivery of information, creator creates information and receives revenue.
guid	0	smth	Readers get access to contribution-only content.
guid	0	smth	It's been seen over time how simple barriers can stop people from doing activities that they want to do and that benefit them and others.
guid	1	smth	I would like to see better integration with Google services across the board, specifically GMail, Google+, and Google Drive.
guid	1	smth	I would like the ability to email articles with GMail, post them to Google+, and save them to Google Drive.; 'cause Google doesn't own quite enough of my soul, yet.
guid	0	smth	"Though this idea has been expressed to varying degrees with regard to specific services, like google translate, I've not seen it expressed generally."""
guid	0	smth	This option existed before.
guid	0	smth	Now I have to go the the source article to have the option to post to a LinkedIn group.
guid	0	smth	It's a relatively minor detail but it would be really convenient.
guid	1	smth	Import RSS from other readers
guid	0	smth	"Beyond Pod is my main feed reader when I'm not on my computer.	"
guid	0	smth	I like it because of its built in browser and various settings for feeds and podcasts, which the Google Reader app didn't have.
guid	1	smth	"Please consider speaking to the people of Beyond Pod to integrate with their app."""
guid	0	smth	Feedly is beautiful, and I would love to use it on my Windows 8 Phone
guid	1	smth	Allow publishers to trigger feedly to refresh feedly's cached version of their RSS feeds.
guid	0	smth	Feedly doesn't seem to notice when existing feed content for a date/time changes and refresh their cache.
guid	1	smth	Letting publishers trigger that refresh could be a work around when there are errors in the publisher's feed.
guid	0	smth	Evernote sharing in feedly seems to cause the Chrome Evernote plugin to sign out the user and then Feedly takes you to a web page version of Evernote, rather than using the Evernote plugin clipper to push it directly into the application or push it transparently to the web.
guid	0	smth	Since i'ts my work computer I can't control the software upgrade.
guid	0	smth	If you don't fix that i will seriously consider droping feedly.
guid	1	smth	Chromecast support would be great so I could read my news on big screen.
guid	1	smth	I love how you have pintrest integration on your images - please consider adding GimmeBar integration as well.
guid	0	smth	The type of users on gimmebar vs pintrest is night and day.
guid	0	smth	great app!
guid	0	smth	gimme bar https://gimmebar.com/
guid	0	smth	As above
guid	1	smth	"I'd love to be able to export all of my ""saved for later"" articles to my kindle so I can read it via e-ink.	"
guid	0	smth	"I used to subscribe to instapaper's premium service and it exported all of my articles into a kindle """"book"""" with a table of contents etc."
guid	0	smth	Feedly allows folder order to be rearranged instead of appearing in alphabetical order.
guid	0	smth	"This is useful to me as I'd prefer that a group or groups of feeds in some folders appear at the bottom of the """"all items view""""."
guid	0	smth	I changed the folder order via the Feedly web interface (organize) but the changes in folder order are not being reflected in Mr. Reader.
guid	0	smth	I logged out of then back into the Feedly account in Mr. Reader but the folders are still appearing in ascending alphabetical order.
guid	1	smth	Please enhance your API.
guid	0	smth	"I rarely use Google Plus, but there are few very interesting people using it who's post I'd like to read.	"
guid	0	smth	For example Linus Torvalds.
guid	1	smth	On Feedly Android App, when I share something through email, it goes straight to Gmail app, when I rather want to use the Regular Email App on that plataform.
guid	1	smth	Make it possible for us to choose the Mail App we want to use!
guid	0	smth	As a feedly users we all know the pain of having to deal with truncated feeds.
guid	0	smth	This problem becomes more prevalent when using mobile apps that rely on feedly like Press on Android.
guid	1	smth	I would like to request the capability to run articles through the readability mobilizer before they're inserted into our feeds.
guid	0	smth	This would help to solve the problem of truncation and poor article formatting.
guid	0	smth	"I have missed the ""email subscriptions"" feature of the old (pre-2008) bloglines ever since they discontinued it."
guid	0	smth	I would gladly become a Feedly Pro subscriber if you offered something comparable.
guid	1	smth	In a nutshell, you could create a bunch of random email addresses that you could use when subscribing to newsletters (etc) and then any emails sent to one of those addresses would show up as a standard HTML feed.
guid	0	smth	This was fantastic for those sites which offer more content in their email newsletter than their RSS feed (or lack an RSS feed completely).
guid	1	smth	A perfect use case for this would be to turn twitter/facebook/etc notifications on and forward those to these email addresses instead of having them clog up my inbox.
guid	0	smth	"This could be used for any of these """"closed"""" services which do not offer RSS feeds."
guid	0	smth	The closest solution to this I have found is to use mailinator to create the throwaway emails (and they support rss feeds) but they also strip out all images/attachments/etc and generate plain text feeds, so this isn't a good solution.
guid	0	smth	"Please consider adding this type of feature to feedly."""
guid	0	smth	In iGoogle there was the Google Reader gadget.
guid	0	smth	One of the very popular alternatives to iGoogle is netvibes.com.
guid	1	smth	It would be cool if there was a feedly gadget for netvibes.
guid	0	smth	oEmbed is a format for allowing an embedded representation of a URL on third party sites.
guid	0	smth	Eagerly waiting on connection with Evernote!
guid	0	smth	There are my tags I use daily.
guid	0	smth	"The way Flipboard has implemented Twitter is that it grabs the content in the tweet and displays it, so rather than a user having to click a link to read an article or view an image, it simply gets the article content or image and displays it, with any text of the tweet acting as a caption.	"
guid	1	smth	"It would be great if I could integrate my Twitter account into Feedly the same way, and have full images or articles displayed alongside my RSS images and articles."""
guid	0	smth	SoundGecko is a great way to be able to listen to articles that you want to read later while in the car or on the go.
guid	0	smth	I use it every day.
guid	1	smth	I would love to have direct integration so that I can easily send articles to SoundGecko from within the Feedly app.
guid	0	smth	"In both cases what should be a """"float:left"""" is actually changed in the code to a """"float:right."""""
guid	0	smth	See attached.
guid	0	smth	This does not occur in Google Reader, where the original layout displays normally.
guid	0	smth	"Since the attribute isn't changed in Reader, I concluded that the problem is with Feedly, not the RSS feed itself."""
guid	1	smth	Please enhance the new back up function (http://blog.feedly.com/2014/07/14/dropbox-vault/) and enable local drive integration.
guid	0	smth	"This would allow anyone to back up to DropBox, GoogleDrive, Synology Cloudstation, Microsoft OneDrive or any other """"cloud"""" solution which has a local drive representation (in addition to allowing me to save it on a local machine)"""
guid	0	smth	"I can login into my account for the past 3 days.	"
guid	0	smth	I was logging in using my google credentials.
guid	0	smth	"The Oauth screen is popping up and hanging,"""
guid	1	smth	It would be nice to be able to add usenet newsgroup in Add Content such as comp.
guid	1	smth	something like AntennaPod (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.danoeh.antennapod) would be very nice
guid	1	smth	Maybe you could send them an API or something so they can add the option to sync with Feedly once GReader disappears.
guid	1	smth	It would be super useful if you are able to choose your own default email app.
guid	0	smth	Not everybody uses the Gmail app as default... some others use CloudMagic, Mailbox, Inbox, K-9 and such_
guid	0	smth	Please guys make it happen!
guid	0	smth	"I cannot login to my Feedly account using Windows 10 Microsoft Edge, even after deleting all cookies etc.	"
guid	0	smth	I can still login with iexplore.
guid	0	smth	"I cannot tell if this is a problem with Edge or with Feedly."""
guid	0	smth	Google Reader allows you to get a public rss feed for each category/label used.
guid	0	smth	"Is very useful for sharing feeds, using it with wordpress blogrolls, ecc..."""
guid	1	smth	It would be great, if google+ button opened an app on iOS(if it is installed).
guid	0	smth	"Google Reader had the option """"Send to > Blogger""""."
guid	0	smth	That's the only feature I'm missing in feedly.
guid	1	smth	It would be nice if we could get the Tumblr heart right in the feedly page like how we can save for later.
guid	1	smth	Reblog support would be nice too but mostly just like at least!
guid	0	smth	I know of many folks -- including yours truly -- who use Feedly in conjunction with Pocket.
guid	0	smth	I noticed that Buffer and Evernote each have a keyboard shortcut in the Web interface.
guid	1	smth	My feature request is rather straightforward, add a similar shortcut for Save to Pocket.
guid	0	smth	"for example if you want to have a feed with a particular tracked tag from tumblr, Feedly could create a feed.	"
guid	0	smth	"For example if you want a feed for every tumblr feed containing the hashtags """" #retail #design """"; """"http://www.tumblr.com/tagged/retail+design""""; would be a feedly feed."""
guid	0	smth	The current version of your Chrome Web App does not behave correctly:; When you click the icon of a Chrome web app this should bring an existing, open window or tab to the front or in case of a window minimize it into the Chrome Launcher or maximize it from there.; Feedly's web app, however, keeps on opening a new window or tab everytime you click on it.
guid	0	smth	The current version of your Chrome Web App does not behave correctly.
guid	0	smth	When you click the icon of a Chrome web app this should bring an existing, open window or tab to the front or in case of a window minimize it into the Chrome Launcher or maximize it from there.
guid	0	smth	That can really drive you nuts as there is almost no other web app that does this (Google+ being the stupid other exception of the rule).
guid	1	smth	Please fix this by updating the manifest.json file inside the app.
guid	0	smth	It should be enough to make the URLs match the actual URL of the open app.
guid	1	smth	"So in case you switch to https do use that in the manifest , too."""
guid	0	smth	Currently if there's a link to an app in the Google Play store it opens in the Feedly browser instead of using the Play app which is frustrating.
guid	0	smth	This is just one example of many so it seems to be a problem with opening in the browser only.
guid	0	smth	We should have the choice!
guid	0	smth	"For instance, Feedpress can't see how many people subscribe to feeds through Feedly.	"
guid	1	smth	Please allow some way for RSS services to get access to that data, especially since Feedly is so big.
guid	0	smth	"Right now it's a black box."""
guid	0	smth	Fix it if you can.
guid	1	smth	How about giving Feedly compatibility with If This Then That?
guid	0	smth	Posting to Pocket via the Chrome extension is currently very laborious (opens in a separate tab, then loads all your Pocket stories every time!).
guid	1	smth	You reader is nearly unusable with tools that allow mouseless browsing (vimperator, pentadactyl), please replace all links you emulated with divs (eg menu on the left) with real hrefs, so these are found by such tools.
guid	1	smth	Let the content creators see that their content is viewed in your service.; Like: http://feedburner.google.com/
guid	0	smth	"I add RSS source by click the RSS icon on the URL bar on Chrome, but with feedly i can't do it.	"
guid	0	smth	Please, make a way to do that.
guid	0	smth	Rendering is messed up in IE10 and 11.
guid	0	smth	I'm SUPER grateful that you guys got it working at all by July 1st, but this is something that will need to be fixed.
guid	0	smth	When showing news as just title lines, in Chrome it'll show 1 title per line, so to say, and the 1st line of the article is revealed after the title or upon clicking on it.
guid	0	smth	In IE10-11, every news line is effectively 2 lines; 1 line for the title, then the 1st line of the article starts AND goes on for a full 2nd line.
guid	0	smth	This looks really weird and is quite distracting when trying to read my RSS.
guid	1	smth	Again, super grateful you guys got it working somewhere other than Chrome (a life saver since I can only use IE on my Windows RT Tablet), but this needs to be fixed eventually.
guid	1	smth	When saving to (Pocket in this case) a third party app, having visual feedback that the save is happening would be useful.
guid	1	smth	"Maybe the press to save could change the item color until saved, and the save icon could be disabled until it is saved"""
guid	0	smth	Now that we have a wonderfully awesome Evernote integration, it's time to make it easier to use.
guid	1	smth	"I have quite a few notebooks and would like to be able to select one notebook as a default so I can simply click the Evernote icon and voila, the article saved to my default notebook."""
guid	0	smth	When I send content from Feedly web to Evernote, the formatting comes across wonky and unclear.
guid	0	smth	When I send it from other similar tools like Mr Reader, it comes across as an article and without the extra content from the website.
guid	1	smth	"I wish to add content in Evernote with the clearest formatting I can so it needs to be better than Feedly currently supports."""
guid	1	smth	"Many people want you to get rid of the need for an extension and make Feedly a pure-web-based app.	"
guid	0	smth	So do I.
guid	0	smth	"If you're not going to, please explain, """"why not?"""""""
guid	1	smth	What I really want are GMail-style filters for feeds, to automatically star or mark as read based on matches.
guid	0	smth	"A typical example: If article subject contains """"this week in"""", mark it as read."
guid	1	smth	"If article body contains """"My Name"""", star it and send to instapaper."
guid	1	smth	"I *think* IFTTT integration could get us there, with not too much in the way of additions, add trigger with pattern or keyword matching on subject, sender, body, etc., add 'mark as read' as an action"""
guid	0	smth	It should be possible to specify actions in IFTTT that mark articles as read when triggered.
guid	1	smth	"I would like to do some action when new articles show in some categories, but I don't want to see them anymore in Feedly after this action is executed."""
guid	0	smth	Lots of blogs contains LaTeX code, to display mathematical characters.
guid	1	smth	This should display as the characters themselves, rather than just as the code.
guid	1	smth	$\alpha$ should be the Greek letter alpha, and so one.
guid	0	smth	This would make it much easier to read philosophical and mathematical blogs.
guid	0	smth	"(Pages created with Wordpress allow this.)"""
guid	0	smth	This would allow you to minimize the rights required for users interested only in the reader.
guid	0	smth	keyword filtering, deleting articles/authors not of interest, prevent unwanted articles from being grabbed by IFTTT.
guid	0	smth	Some Tumblrs I read have passwords on them.
guid	1	smth	It'd be great to have a way to add these feeds to Feedly by allowing us to enter the password once from Feedly
guid	1	smth	Make it possible for me to open articles and links inside articles IN SAFARI, from within feedly.
guid	1	smth	I am looking for something like this but for feedly https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/checker-plus-for-google-r/lbmpmiibbncadgagnfcloaeilfhomemb
guid	1	smth	Create Delicious integration to allow sharing to delicious.com
guid	0	smth	The side area allows you to include your Facebook and Twitter feed.
guid	1	smth	"If you're using Feedly as your homepage, a quick overview of upcoming events might be nice."""
guid	1	smth	Please let me sign in with an ID and password I chose (not my google account)
guid	1	smth	I'd like to connect articles with items in my calendar.
guid	0	smth	E.g. I read an article about concert and add an item to calendar attaching link to article.
guid	0	smth	Or I read an article about grant or scholarship and create calendar item for documents submission deadline attaching link to article.
guid	0	smth	I'm limited to IE 7 on Windows XP at work.
guid	0	smth	All I get is the same white screen all the IE 8 and IE 9 users are complaining about.
guid	1	smth	Is there anything you can do to make Feedly work on IE 7?
guid	0	smth	"Hi Few day ago I have started using you excelent app, but one thing annoying me.	"
guid	0	smth	My favorite web page which id http://lodz.naszemiasto.pl/rss/artykuly/1.xml is not acceptable by your app.
guid	0	smth	"Could you fix it?"""
guid	0	smth	"Hello Feedly developers, here is a proposal on how to create a win win situation for readers and content creators.	"
guid	0	smth	Flattr is still not lifting, mainly due to a lack off content creators willing to register themselves at flatter.
guid	0	smth	Also flatters prototypish content search function makes it hard for users to find proper content.
guid	0	smth	Feedly has a user friendly interface with a pretty reliable search function and share options to several other applications.
guid	1	smth	It might be an idea to add a flatter function to feedly.
guid	1	smth	Alternatively, a simple flattr-inspired donate function might do it. 
guid	1	smth	feedly pro readers sign up for the 'donate' option where they can donate an amount of money for articles they liked. 
guid	1	smth	The amount of the donation is up to the user, the user pays in advance into his pro-account and may spend that money for article donations.
guid	0	smth	As a feedback, a graphical representation of number and amount of donations and how many readers have read and/or donated a certain article is shown.
guid	0	smth	"In this way, the current intransparent """"recommendation count"""" would become more transparent."
guid	1	smth	All articles can be donated too.
guid	1	smth	"The donated money will be transferred to all publishers who are interested in getting donations, similar to """"unclaimed flatters""""."
guid	1	smth	Bloggers/Authors who want to claim their money do this by registering their rss-feed and bank- or paypal-account at feedly.
guid	1	smth	After registration, unclaimed donations will be transferred from donator to author.
guid	0	smth	Benefits: gives readers an easy way to support the authors and content they like.
guid	0	smth	gives content creators an additional revenue model.
guid	0	smth	gives feedly an additional revenue model.
guid	0	smth	opens up further possibilities around subscription, paid-only content, contributors influencing content creators, etc.
guid	1	smth	Feedly could re-invent the way we consume articles in the same way how Amazons Kindle Unlimited did with the book market.
guid	1	smth	An easy-to-use donate-function might turn feedly pro into a universal news portal for fact-based quality news.
guid	0	smth	This function might change the independent news market in a similar way as Amazons Kindle unlimited did to the book market and might attract both readers and authors to sign up for a feedly account.
guid	0	smth	Anyway, the most important feature is to find the simplest way to transfer money from article-readers to article-authors.
guid	0	smth	Feedly could be the perfect platform for that.
guid	0	smth	"I have two twitter accounts that I use regularly, one for work and a personal account.	"
guid	0	smth	I often post to both from Feedly, but this requires a lot of logging in and out.
guid	0	smth	"Integration with Tweetdeck would allow me to easily post to either account."""
guid	0	smth	I often want to read articles at a later time in Safari's Readling List.
guid	1	smth	Would love to have a direct link to do this.
guid	1	smth	"Do you think it's possible to mod this little software ""Google Reader Notifier"" by Yonizaf (http://code.google.com/p/google-reader-notifier-windows/) to notify us when new Feedly feeds are available."
guid	0	smth	Currently in browser and mobile version one has often to do two step navigation to go to original content (e.g. youtube rss for uploads, in browser and mobile version it embeddes video, which is not what some of us want
guid	1	smth	I prefer to see original content most of the time) so along with mark as read / save links there could be URL link which will drive to the original site.
guid	0	smth	"Applies to browser and mobile versions."""
guid	1	smth	It would be awesome to play all videos one by one like in a playlist but without a hassle of creating one.
guid	0	smth	I often have many short videos which I have to click individually which is pretty annoying when I want to do sth else and not touch computer.
guid	0	smth	Feedly is a website.
guid	0	smth	Luakit is a browser.
guid	1	smth	I *should* be able to use feedly in luakit.
guid	0	smth	I understand that offline support is being worked on and can't wait to use that functionality, however since Google Reader is shutting down within weeks, and BYLINE reader is the ONLY offline reader currently available for commuters, it would be fantastic if you could work together... 
guid	1	smth	"The Android app is missing a ""mark as unread"" option."
guid	1	smth	It would be great if you could add a link / bookmark right into your Diigo account while reading in Feedly.

guid	0	smth	Footnote popovers, as used on many popular blogs and Wikipedia, display the footnote itself within a pop-up bar or text bubble right next to the main article text it relates to.

guid	1	smth	Please remove unsaved items from Dropbox (or add a preference).
guid	0	smth	Would also mitigate this:

guid	0	smth	I love Feedly, it's a really well-programmed app.
guid	0	smth	Nevertheless there's one thing that annoys me
guid	0	smth	when I press a link in an article that I'm reading on feedly then the link will always open inside Feedly.
guid	0	smth	sometimes it's necessary to open links in the browser, out of convenience and sometimes for usability.
guid	0	smth	usually I end up opening the link in feedly, wait for the site to load, and then i go into the options menu to open the site once more in chrome.
guid	1	smth	"it would be so much easier just to have a context-menu item that gives the option to open a link directly in the browser."""
guid	0	smth	Support for reading latest gmail mails directly from inbox feed just the same as igoogle
guid	1	smth	"Possibly some translation functionality might be useful."""
guid	0	smth	We can set the preferred browser on iOS, this rocks.
guid	0	smth	However if I then click on sharing and google plus, it opens in safari.
guid	1	smth	"My suggestion is to honour the preferred browser, if chosen, when using more generic based web sharing services."""
guid	0	smth	I do not need all the Pro features.
guid	1	smth	"I'd love to pay $10/year just for evernote integration, though."""
guid	0	smth	This function is currently available in the Gmail and Pocket iOS apps, in which a button appears at the top left corner of the Chrome browser which will allow the user to quickly return to Feedly when they view a page in Chrome from Feedly.
guid	0	smth	"More convenient than using multitask function."""
guid	0	smth	Integration or support to work with Net News Wire for Mac and Reeder and Instapaper for iOS
guid	0	smth	"Recently, there was a change that forced you to use a Buffer account to share to social networks, such as Facebook.	"
guid	0	smth	Seems kind of pointless for those who don't have a Buffer account (nor want one) to have to create an account, and have it be the middleman between Feedly and Facebook.
guid	0	smth	I LOVED the way Facebook sharing was!
guid	0	smth	Clean, at the end of articles, and available for comments before posting.
guid	0	smth	"If it ain't broke, don't fix it."""
guid	0	smth	Feedly allowed mailing articles through gmail directly instead of bringing up a mail client.
guid	1	smth	I want that feature back as I would like to mail my articles directly.
guid	1	smth	"When I tag an article in feedly, i want the tags to follow when i export the article to evernote (with the built in evernote feature for Feedly Pro plan).	"
guid	0	smth	"As it is now when i export, with the evernote-button, an article i have to manually log in to evernote and ad the tag again."""
guid	1	smth	It would be nice if we were able to view content from Twitter embeds (such as images) in Feedly.
guid	0	smth	Some libsyn feeds don't link to the libsyn item but rather the audio file directly.
guid	0	smth	You used to be able to right click on the item in feedly and save it.
guid	0	smth	Now you have to open the file and use save page as.
guid	0	smth	Please fix this.
guid	0	smth	BeeLine Reader (full disclosure: I'm the founder) has browser plugins that apply eye-guiding color gradients to make reading faster and easier.
guid	0	smth	Over 85% of people find that these gradients improve readability, and the plugins work great on feedly.
guid	1	smth	But the BeeLine functionality could be built into the feedly UI, using the BeeLine javascript library.
guid	1	smth	add Google+ as option for feed that appear on the left in the app and also in your main feed
guid	0	smth	"When we long-press on a link in Feedly or in a web view, we're given the option to add it to Reading List, but not to Instapaper or any of the other Read Later services.	"
guid	1	smth	"When you select a preferred RL service, it should also be available when you long-press a link so that you can send that link directly to your favorite service, rather than having to open the link, wait for it to load, then send it to Instapaper or Pocket or whatever you prefer."""
guid	0	smth	I have searched high and low - Google, DuckDuckGo, feedly.com (which redirects me to my feeds, from where there are no other links), PimpMySafari (dead link) Apple's Safari Extension Gallery - everywhere.
guid	0	smth	I see people talking about the extension all over the place - but for the life of me, I cannot locate a link to the damn thing.
guid	0	smth	The abillity to export an article or post directly to Kindle or/and other e-book readers.
guid	0	smth	"In the Firefox extension, selecting ""oldest first"" under ""change layout..."" doesn't stick.	"

guid	1	smth	"Import ""google current"" feeds into feedly"
guid	1	smth	Add ability to share whole articles to Evernote.
guid	0	smth	This option is very important when RSS feed contains only text excerpt.
guid	1	smth	make feedly more sandboxed
guid	0	smth	"I have a chrome icon in the action bar.	"
guid	0	smth	"I think its for """"open in browser"""" or maybe """"share with chrome""""."
guid	1	smth	Anyway, it'd be great if this opened the currently visible article in the browser instead of the previous article.
guid	0	smth	"That's how it used to work and I think that makes more sense."""
guid	0	smth	"Sometimes after I've clicked into an article--into a Chrome tab--and then clicked the ""Back"" button, I end up at the Feedly app's top level, rather than at the article summary."
guid	0	smth	I'm presented with the Feedly app's splash screen along the way.
guid	0	smth	"As is, one has to open each post one wants to read later.	"
guid	0	smth	"Often I have little time and just want to scan headlines, and make sure the ones that seem important get into the readitlater pile."""
guid	1	smth	Unify login feedly allowing access by more than one source (or facebook or Google or Microsoft or ...).
guid	0	smth	Just depending on what the user decided accounts relate.
guid	1	smth	I would like the Feedly Chrome app to act just like the Google Reader one, shows how many feeds I have and I can click on them individually.
guid	1	smth	Add the number of followers to your subscribe button (like Bloglovin already does) to be displayed on blogs.
guid	1	smth	Provide the html code with your other buttons.
guid	1	smth	Integrate Twitter cards on article preview page, so that when viewing an article that has an embedded twitter card with all its information, it shows the card instead of plain text.
guid	0	smth	"When I save an article to Evernote, the resulting note is the text and images, but not what the webpage looks like.	"

guid	0	smth	"I currently use Pocket as my """"read later"""" app, but was hoping to move to Evernote."""
guid	1	smth	"Right now it takes 2 clicks and navigating to another tab for saving to pocket, it would be nice if it's handled in the same window with pop-up , or just with single click.	"
guid	1	smth	"Also, if it's possible to override save for later to pocket."""
guid	1	smth	I'd like to have feedly integrate with bit.ly.

guid	1	smth	"Please allow Chrome feedly (and other browsers' feedly) to customize favourite saving tool, so that I can save to pocket with one click (and please also cut the settings on the pocket's end for ""adding a new item"")."
guid	0	smth	Would be most appreciated!
guid	0	smth	I currently use gRead widget to see my unread count on Google Reader.

guid	0	smth	"might have to check to see if they have its data into it."""
guid	0	smth	I like the feedly interface more than the Instapaper interface.
guid	1	smth	I would like to read my Instapaper saved articles via feedly.
guid	0	smth	"We use Feedly and the Buffer link in a work environment.	"
guid	0	smth	I have Googled and found at the moment, Feedly only works on one web browser which is Google Chrome.
guid	0	smth	We are limited to one browser (which is Internet Explorer) in our work environment so we are currently unable to use your services.
guid	1	smth	Please can you give us a fix or enable your program to work in IE.
guid	0	smth	"Other user's who are using your program for work purposes will have a similar problem as it makes it difficult for IT teams to support more than one browser."""
guid	1	smth	I'd like to be able to save articles to MindSky similar to other integrations.
guid	0	smth	As available with their save tool: http://sky.mind.im/6301

guid	1	smth	Apply the awesome mobile app feature to the web interface!
guid	1	smth	I would love to be able to save directly to Pocket like I can on the android app.
guid	0	smth	"This will present with more options to subscribe to."""

guid	1	smth	"So my suggestion is to offer developers a switch to turn on/off pro features in the sandbox.	"
guid	0	smth	"Obviously this should be somehow restricted so that this system can't be abused."""
guid	0	smth	"Feedly always inserts ""quotation marks"" in posts to Buffer."
guid	1	smth	Please remove the quotation marks or make Buffer post template editable like already the Twitter post template.
guid	0	smth	The use case is that I'm surfing the web and I find a site that I'd like to follow.
guid	0	smth	The ability to let indigo read the title of the posts perhaps with commands to marks as unread, save even read the whole article Like an interactive radio
guid	0	smth	"You Recently added function and allowed us to save an article to; Evernote , that's great !	"
guid	0	smth	However , ___________________________ ( Evernote's service for China ) is not supported.
guid	1	smth	"Please do not abandon market in China !"""
guid	1	smth	Please remove google+ requirement.
guid	1	smth	It would be great if chrome and opera weren't the only options for opening up articles in.
guid	0	smth	"Due to the way your article popup is positioned, its """"close"""" button sits directly above the side pane."
guid	0	smth	"Although my mouse click is properly sent to the """"close"""" button, any mouse movement after the popup goes away, is sent to the side pane -- which causes it to """"intelligently"""" expand and reflow the list of articles that I am trying to read."
guid	0	smth	"It's really annoying."""
guid	0	smth	I really love how I can browse the latest articles from all feeds on the iOS version but this doesn't seem to be an option on the chrome web app version?
guid	0	smth	I might just not be able to find the option so if someone else has anything to add then please comment.
guid	0	smth	Keep the awesome work up guys!
guid	1	smth	At some point can we get Google Keep integration to go along side Pocket?
guid	0	smth	That is if they have an API for it.
guid	1	smth	I would like to receive the headlines (as items arrive) to my IM-client.
guid	0	smth	As soon as I log in online, your jabber-bot could return to 10 (20, 30 ... looking as defined in the settings) of fresh news headlines.

guid	0	smth	my facebook page is blocked by the plugin.
guid	0	smth	I uninstalled all plugins and I only reactivated the feedly plugin to be sure
guid	1	smth	If I have a feed in a folder named COOKING I would like the IFTTT ingredient entitled ArticleCategories to return COOKING.
guid	0	smth	Currently it returns nothing.
guid	1	smth	Please make an app for blackberry playbook, because there are no apps that support feedly on blackberry app world for playbook.
guid	0	smth	This would make integration with other stuff (eg newsbeuter) possible.
guid	0	smth	This could make the Feedly OPML a canonical source of feeds for other apps that a user wants to use.
guid	1	smth	Reset the RSS subscribe function after someone uninstalls your extension.
guid	0	smth	The current uninstall leaves several settings in your about config and makes other changes which make it impossible to subscribe using Live Bookmarks anymore.
guid	0	smth	I've had to switch back to Feedly just so I can subscribe to new feeds!!!
guid	0	smth	For me, it actually provides a worse experience than the builtin browser, it brings Chrome to the foreground and opens the link I tapped in a new tab.
guid	0	smth	To get back to feedly, I have to back out or go into recent apps.
guid	1	smth	What I want is to be able to skim through my feed items and quickly open N tabs in the background, then go to my browser and read through them at my leisure.
guid	1	smth	However, if in article/title view, allow long press to bring up a menu.
guid	0	smth	open in new external browser tab;
guid	1	smth	at least allow configuring the action for long press.
guid	0	smth	A lot of the RSS feeds I read force you to go to the full site to read the full article.
guid	0	smth	Lifehacker is a good example.
guid	1	smth	One thing that would be nice is the ability to be able to hit one button to open all of the unread articles for a category in new browser tabs rather than having to click each one separately.
guid	1	smth	"It would be nice to have a similar feature on mobile, except the way it would work would be to add all of the articles to Pocket or an alternative read-it-later app, """"Pocket all"""" or something like that."""
guid	0	smth	"The ""Good read"" tagline isn't attached to my twitter posts when I schedule the posts through buffer."
guid	1	smth	"Please add this feature."""
guid	1	smth	Make it possible to link an article to your Facebook business page
guid	1	smth	Right now Feedly isn't consistantly running across browser, this needs to be investigated and fixed.
guid	0	smth	I work which adivertisement so i like to seeing new video ideas, but when i try to see VEVO video on the feedly i never can, only youtube videos.
guid	0	smth	The unfortunate thing about this is that if I had an RSS feed, I'd include it in feedly but google+ does not offer this.
guid	1	smth	It would be great if there was a way to see all of the content I'd see in google+ via the API, and present it in feedly.
guid	1	smth	"Being able to add a 1 click feed for Facebook (https://www.facebook.com/help/212445198787494/) would also be quite useful."""
guid	0	smth	I have noticed that it is difficult to add new blogs that I want to follow, including my own.
guid	0	smth	When I search for emi ito illustration or the website, www.emiitoillustration.com, nothing comes up.
guid	0	smth	This is the case even when I have subscribed to the blog through feedly through the feedly button on my blog.
guid	1	smth	would be cool if I could view the basecamp progress feed in feedly.
guid	0	smth	I use the saved items while on mobile to flag items for review on PC.
guid	1	smth	It would be nice to have an indicator on the Chrome extension icon to remind me if I have saved items to review.
guid	1	smth	I need Huffduffer integration to send selected audiofiles from within my rss-feeds to this service.
guid	0	smth	Worked perfectly in Google Reader.
guid	0	smth	"depends on connections and permits (their are not just one profile related posts).	 "
guid	0	smth	"It requires an integration with Google+ API, perhaps even cooperate with Google to make this specific data accessible."""
guid	0	smth	IE 9 VERSION ?
guid	0	smth	With IE9 and later in Windows 7 and Windows 8, you can drag a web site URL from the address bar to the taskbar and pin the site to your taskbar for easy access.
guid	0	smth	This makes for quick access to the site.
guid	0	smth	IMO it also helps with the brand of the site as the app is front and center for the user and feels like any other application.
guid	0	smth	Web sites like Tweetdeck, Pandora, Facebook, Bing, etc. all include this functionality.
guid	0	smth	Most even incorporate jump lists into the pinned site icon.
guid	1	smth	When viewing feeds from dribbble.com, I would like to have a 'Like' button that is integrated with the 'Like' mechanisms from their site
guid	0	smth	"When browsing a site with RSS and ATOM metadata header, the Chroma and Firefox plugin presents a ""transparent button"" to quickly and easily allow you to add this feed to Feedly."
guid	1	smth	"Could the same be added to Safari."""
guid	0	smth	Having a pop-up window open is pretty clunky.
guid	1	smth	Should just be able to click the icon and (assuming the account link is active/signed-in) send to Readability.
guid	1	smth	"It would be really helpfull to have a feature of that shortens articles like Summly or Wavii.	"
guid	0	smth	Furthermore it'll have to be compatible with any RSS Feed i have in my list.
guid	0	smth	"For that kind of feature compared with the already existing and wonderfull feedly i would love to pay, because it makes my reading faster."""
guid	0	smth	Recently the 'visit website' launches the internal browser but it fails to load anything.
guid	0	smth	You can launch Safari from the internal button but then you have to bounce back and forth between apps.
guid	0	smth	This works fine on the iPhone but not on iPad.
guid	0	smth	So I am using URL for recent uploads from a YouTube account, example: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=UUISPcad-6svNxgViVr_syvA;
guid	0	smth	"The page from the URL loads fine and shows recent uploads but subscribing to that URL in Feedly is missing out some videos, for example, I can't see video: ""Europa Universalis IV Common Sense Multiplayer 21"" on the feed."
guid	0	smth	It was uploaded yesterday thought Feedly shows some videos before it and after it, why that one is missing!?
guid	0	smth	Not sure if that's YouTube only related, spotted it with YT.
guid	0	smth	"That's really bad though, we might be missing some random content and noone would know about it!"""
guid	1	smth	Please use feedly users rather than google's users
guid	1	smth	I suggest a Feedly to Google Calendar feature.
guid	1	smth	I saw a TV Preview for a Show next week and I want to be reminded regarding this feed entry.
guid	1	smth	"It will be great if you will develop a Windows software, for those who would like to read their feed on the computer.	"
guid	1	smth	"Or at least make the browser extension useful (Firefox add-on has no use...)"""
guid	1	smth	I want a one stop shop for all of these aspects of my internet life.
guid	0	smth	I just click subscribe and they appear in my feedly.
guid	0	smth	"Something similar to flipboard's functionality, except your feed reader is immensely better than theirs."""
guid	1	smth	I'd like to plug Feedly into Mac's RSS screensaver, but believe there is no way to do it.
guid	1	smth	I would like to be able to thumbs up or down videos from my YouTube feeds from within Feedly.
guid	1	smth	Also, allow a YouTube video to continue to play while I scroll through the rest of my feeds.
guid	1	smth	Please add Evernote support to the iPhone for Pro users
guid	0	smth	Why was it necessary for us all to have.
guid	0	smth	Cloud version but no option or explanation at any time that all my feeds have gone.
guid	0	smth	"First of all, I love feedly.	"
guid	1	smth	I'd like to suggest reverting the change that was made in last version, regarding the safari browser stuff.
guid	0	smth	I use my phone with left hand, and feedly was great, thumb would scroll, swipe, touch to open articles.
guid	0	smth	"Once in the article, whether within feedly or in safari I would press the """"back"""" button top left."
guid	0	smth	"Now the change has me reaching top right for the """"done"""" button ."
guid	0	smth	 Disappointing from a ux perspective, cause before it was perfect and seemless; gets worse with bigger phones of course.
guid	0	smth	I use Evernote to store all of my note and picture from web pages.
guid	1	smth	It would be great to have some integration with that app.
guid	1	smth	Feedly v15.0.1 fails to post to Twitter from iOS 5.1.1, needs to be fixed.
guid	0	smth	The share icon can prevent a user to click on something behind even if it's a small icon.
guid	0	smth	And i play some times with javascript and it's influence by my script but in the extension bar it won't bother my script anymore.
guid	0	smth	Same for debugging webpage;
guid	1	smth	And or you can make it a keyboard shortcut's
guid	1	smth	Integration with offline translator/dictionary is highly needed such as goldendict, just add an icon to open the dictionary when pointing to a word in an artical
guid	0	smth	"To view the full article, via the ""visit website"" or by clicking the title, freezes the loading of the page within Feedly browser"
guid	1	smth	Add UI element a/o shortcut to quickly add reference to default Evernote folder w/t popup dialog or confirmation.
guid	0	smth	Hi, I really enjoy using feedly (Nextgen) on Windows Phone 8, and was excited to see the workflow with Onenote, which i already use for all my other note taking.

guid	0	smth	I've been a fan of feedly but am now losing heart.
guid	0	smth	I've updated my ipad and now can't use feedly with buffer at all.
guid	0	smth	I've tried deleting apps and different configuration but impossible.
guid	1	smth	Why don't you test your blasted products before launching changes.
guid	0	smth	you alienate your users and then impossible to get any sort of service to fix the problem.
guid	0	smth	"""To import an OPML file"" still shows a link to http://cloud/feedly.com but the link is redirecting."

guid	0	smth	"This can be added alongside Twitter, Google+ and other buttons."""
guid	1	smth	Like many others, I want to add some Twitter feeds as RSS feeds.
guid	0	smth	There are several older threads on this issue with some suggestions that no longer seem to work.
guid	1	smth	To Feedly, can you please provide this type of service - perhaps within you Pro account if there are extra overheads.
guid	1	smth	And can you please make the formatting support direct linking from the URLs embedded in the tweets.
guid	1	smth	"It would be good to not have to link to Twitter to get a usable URL"""";"

guid	0	smth	I'm wondering what the latest solutions people are using to read Twitter feeds in Feedly.
guid	0	smth	When techbargain.com updated their site, it no longer worked with feedly.
guid	0	smth	I use Google Auth for both Pocket and for Feedly.
guid	0	smth	I can log in to Feedly, that works fine.
guid	0	smth	I chose Pocket as my preferred saving tool.
guid	0	smth	"When I try to save to Pocket though I get """"Please configure ...""""."
guid	0	smth	In the Pocket settings I only seem to have the ability to set a Pocket username and password.

guid	1	smth	I want to be able to just log into Feedly and not have it log me out if I log out of Google.
guid	1	smth	Bring back 1 tap saving to Pocket in iOS Apps.
guid	0	smth	Opening the word definition ins new windows does not make sense specially in an iPad.

guid	0	smth	Flipboard has a awesome way of doing it (but your RSS management is far better !)
guid	1	smth	Please add wiznote support as you support evernote.
guid	0	smth	Hasn't been updating Craiglist feeds for awhile, even though Outlook and igHome are updating those same feeds.
guid	1	smth	"The RSS markup of these feeds identifies the author (e.g. ""dc:creator""), use that to set the author attribute for the Evernote note?"
guid	1	smth	If author isn't available, than set author to name of the site or blog?
guid	0	smth	When using Feedly on a mobile device, location information becomes available to the app as well.
guid	1	smth	Could Feedly also set these note attributes when exporting to Evernote?
guid	1	smth	Perhaps other additional attributes?
guid	0	smth	Tags could be good and bad depending on how a user uses Evernote.
guid	1	smth	That being said, exporting tags as well could be a master setting someone could toggle on or off.; Basically improving the depth of integration with Evernote.
guid	0	smth	Currently, Feedly Syncs with Google Reader.
guid	1	smth	Since Google Reader is going away on July 1st, I think it would be an awesome if Feedly sync's with TheOldReader, it would be a great partnership for both of you.
guid	0	smth	I just noticed that when i tried to view an RSS feed from blogspot, it automatically prompted Feedly to show the feed.
guid	0	smth	I'm a web developer and I just wanted to copy the URL of the feed.
guid	0	smth	Is there a way to toggle this automatic feature?
guid	0	smth	"If not, can you offer it?"""
guid	1	smth	Add integration with Toodledo

guid	1	smth	A list of my RSS feeds should be available as a public shareable list that I can attach to a cover letter and let the company I interview for create a better picture as a person.
guid	0	smth	Same as an integration for linkedin.
guid	0	smth	Not individual articles, list as a whole.
guid	1	smth	Allow to pin things to pinterest
guid	1	smth	"If I could add individual users as a feed, then I could see their updates without having to scroll through Facebook's ridiculous ""wall""."
guid	0	smth	The same for Twitter.
guid	1	smth	"Just being able to add a Twitter account and view only a single user's tweets would easily make Feedly one of the best Twitter platforms there is."""
guid	1	smth	Please prevent duplicate saved items in Dropbox.
guid	0	smth	"For Feedly Pro users, when a PDF is generated for depositing in Dropbox for later reading, that you offer an option for whether bookmarks are auto-generated inside Feedly's PDF.	"
guid	0	smth	Adobe Acrobat doesn't allow the user to set an option to perma-hide the bookmarks pane, and I guestimate that 99% of the PDFs Feedly Pro generates only have one bookmark (the article title).
guid	0	smth	It's annoying to have Acrobat auto-open a useless bookmark listing (one entry) in the reading window because it decreases the visible screen real estate devoted to rendering the PDF.
guid	0	smth	"This is way more Adobe's UI problem than yours."""
guid	0	smth	Feedly to Google plus causes the Feedly app to crash back to the home screen on Kindle Fire.
guid	0	smth	pointemy domain to feedly ?
guid	0	smth	visitors can see www.domain.com ?
guid	1	smth	When we want to email news or feed records feedly do it via outlook, it is better to send it via gmail or make an option for it.
guid	1	smth	"I use RockMelt as browser and feedly won't load, he loads just fine in google chrome, but I would like to be able to use it with RockMel"""

guid	0	smth	"why the need ""Access to data on ALL websites"".	"
guid	0	smth	Often, this kind of item needs to see all pages so that it can perform a limited task such as looking for RSS feeds that you might want to subscribe to.
guid	0	smth	Two problems: I have to click twice on a YouTube video to be played.
guid	0	smth	After the first click the actual video shows up in a smaller region.
guid	0	smth	"For solid users/sharing, often categories are organized by priority/tier or other purpose, not what makes most sense for social sharing and assigning tags to a specific feed.	"
guid	0	smth	This drives me crazy and feels like an invasion of privacy.
guid	0	smth	"Is there any way to undo this?"""
guid	0	smth	Each time I use the chrome app it asks to connect to Google Reader.
guid	0	smth	I just reinstalled Firefox on a new machine and I can't login to Feedly via Google authentication.
guid	0	smth	It works fine with Chrome & IE but when I click the Login link in Firefox nothing happens.
guid	0	smth	At work I received an alert from Feedly that I needed to update to v16 of the plugin.
guid	0	smth	When I get home I see that my home system is running v14., but I can't get to feedly.com regardless of what I do because the plugin knows better than me.
guid	0	smth	Even after I log out of feedly.
guid	0	smth	I have toy disable the extension.
guid	1	smth	Please make it possible to go to feedly.com or make it possible to download an update from within the extension?
guid	0	smth	Hi, I am not sure where i can claim problems.
guid	0	smth	The Feedly App is showing me an error since a couple of days.
guid	0	smth	It is equal if i use my iPad or my iphone (different provider sim cards) , both are showing me the error that no connection is there.
guid	0	smth	After that i downloaded other feedly apps like Ziner, they work without any problem.
guid	0	smth	"What can i do?"""
guid	1	smth	I wish to connect feedy with social networks (youtube, vimeo, tumblr, instagram,...) to synchronize the news and our favorites.
guid	0	smth	When can we command Feedly through our voice?
guid	0	smth	This will be an excellent advantage compared with other options.
guid	0	smth	"Yes, your are right, too similar to """"Her"""", the movie."
guid	0	smth	But I think it's necessary.
guid	0	smth	Come on guys, Twitter is winning the battle for far!!!!!
guid	0	smth	I want Feedly to be bigger!!!!!!!
guid	0	smth	Feedly mini is very nice plug-in for me.
guid	0	smth	"but, the feedly mini icon is not shown on the naver blog such as http://panboy.blog.me or http://blog.naver.com/panboy"""
guid	0	smth	When you tap the Pocket or Instapaper icon, there isn't much of a visual induction that the article has been saved

guid	0	smth	I am not sure if this is due to feedly app limitation or something else.
guid	0	smth	"But text-only imports, with just a link, as I come up with with gmail app is poor."""
guid	0	smth	"I started using a new Chrome app called Hacker Vision.	"
guid	0	smth	If flips the screen resolution so most webages have a dark back ground and fonts are light colors.
guid	0	smth	It is supposed to be easier on your eyes.
guid	0	smth	So far I'm liking it, but the colors are sometimes off.; 
guid	0	smth	What i have noticed is that the Feedly mini toolbar that pops up on the bottom right of web pages, when i want to share the link via that mini feedly toolbar, the background color and the color of the icons (twitter, buffer, etc.) are all the same color.
guid	0	smth	Any way you can fix this?
guid	0	smth	is this a problem that Hacker Vision needs to address?
guid	0	smth	Please advise.
guid	0	smth	Google Reader used to be able to do this with pretty much every URL you threw at it, and it doesn't seem to be terribly complicated.
guid	0	smth	Giving this URL to feedly returns no feeds.
guid	0	smth	However, if you manually Google what the standard format for feeds is with Wordpress and try out ?
guid	0	smth	Which seems like something that Feedly might have been able to guess to begin with.
guid	0	smth	I had to turn off the Windows tray app.
guid	0	smth	I'm sure it's the app, because exiting it cleared up all the browser response problems.
guid	1	smth	"Either fix it or make Feedly work always-on without browser interference."""
guid	0	smth	not much else to say...include an icon for Flipboard
guid	0	smth	Integration with other social media so I can read all the latest tweets, google+ updates and others from with the feedly app.
guid	0	smth	You have a group of friends with send my favorite post writing command.
guid	0	smth	Currently, some of the RSS items are lists of links.
guid	0	smth	Expected behavior when I follow one of the links, find it interesting and click the Pocket icon, is to save the clicked-through article.
guid	0	smth	Instead, it saves the initial RSS item.
guid	0	smth	Take Mike Tyson's channel for example.
guid	0	smth	"That string, """"UCdtNjOwfQpgVK0FyOeLyzrg"""", or any channel like that, doesn't work with Feedly."
guid	1	smth	You have to go in and get the RSS via https://www.youtube.com/rss/channel/<string>/feed.rss, please automate this.
guid	0	smth	I created a few ideas in the get satisfaction community (don't remember how I got there) and was very surprised never to get an answer... until I realized you guys worked in user voice...
guid	0	smth	"There appears to be a current bug with the android app and the Evernote integration.	"
guid	0	smth	For about the last week, when I try to save, it forces me to re-login to Evernote.
guid	0	smth	I noticed several of my Facebook pages weren't updating and then saw this announcement that Facebook has stopped updating RSS feeds.
guid	0	smth	The few that I follow are for ones where no website exists for them.
guid	0	smth	I love feedly for following them; please find a way!
guid	0	smth	Hey I have feedly notifier in firefox on windows 8.
guid	0	smth	when I click the icon it just says no unread articles where it used to show lots of articles I could open in new tabs.
guid	0	smth	as it occurs on Android and iOS.
guid	0	smth	I cannot, for example, highlight a friend when I'm trying to tell something to him in my post.
guid	0	smth	Second, why don't work with metro style on FB app?
guid	0	smth	Why this common and ridiculous traditional FAcebook style?
guid	1	smth	Why Microsoft doesn't close this vacuum spaces, this things it really needs.
guid	0	smth	The rotation style of metro will be awesome.
guid	0	smth	I remember, in the beginning, the FB works with this pattern and unfortunately, you abandoned.
guid	0	smth	When using Internet Explorer in Windows Phone 8 on Nokia Lumia 1350 (OS 8.0.10517.150) I noticed that pointing to specific section of any document (using #name) doesn't work from pages using frameset (doctype is correctly set to HTML 4.01 supporting framesets).
guid	0	smth	To verify, try clicking on any method in Java Javadoc, for example open http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/ and click through -> java.applet -> AppletContext -> getApplet.
guid	0	smth	Java site uses brackets in links names which is not ok but this is not related to this issue and even links without brackets don't work.
guid	1	smth	Trial feature should be built-in with auto-prompted and disabling, just like the Windows Store.
guid	0	smth	If the user uninstalls during a trial, if even tracks this fact and prevents them from starting a new trial later.
guid	1	smth	Contract this with the Windows Phone world, where we tell you we want trial mode, but we have to track the number of days since install, whether the user has purchased, etc.
guid	0	smth	If the user uninstalls and installs again later, we have no idea.
guid	0	smth	For an app that doesn't require a login, so there's no account to tie the usage to, and doesn't have a natural way to limit functionality, adding a trial-mode feels like implement-and-pray.
guid	0	smth	With the two stores combining, can we bring this to Windows Phone?
guid	0	smth	Contract this with the Windows Phone world, where we tell you we want trial mode, but we have to track the number of days since install, whether the user has purchased,___ more
guid	0	smth	You can only select text as big as screen.
guid	0	smth	If larger it doesnt scroll down so you can only select part of the text.
guid	0	smth	If iOS and Android can do it why can't Windows Phone?
guid	0	smth	Like all the Timer apps on Android & iOS, they can update the badge numbers real time giving you a true countdown timer experience.
guid	0	smth	Why cant Windows Phone do this?
guid	0	smth	It should be able to do this!
guid	0	smth	Would battery experience really degrade that much?
guid	0	smth	If so me thinks this is a fundamental flaw in the OS!
guid	0	smth	is it possible to get a flash player for wp8 or Silverlight for wp8 more and more websites doesn't work by video clips
guid	1	smth	There need to be a business app settings launcher native in the API.
guid	1	smth	"On my What's new panel in Contacts I want to see posts from Facebook from people that are ""subscribed"" (followed) and not for all friends."
guid	0	smth	I have WP7.x.
guid	0	smth	Probably in WP8.x it's fixed?
guid	0	smth	Please give me info.
guid	0	smth	The RSS section does not seem to work when the app is installed.
guid	0	smth	The phone can reach the xml file and it does work in the preview in the App Studio.
guid	1	smth	remove the lock screen and make it a notifications screen
guid	0	smth	Want to add an image (like Radar, Cloud layer, drone image, etc) to a Phone Map and have it scale relative to the zoom layer.
guid	0	smth	Our app requires to call a web service from the Application_Deactivated/Application_Closing event to generate an analytics report.
guid	0	smth	Currently windows phone does not allow to call a webservice from these events.
guid	0	smth	Now that beta apps do not expire, we, the developers need a way to force remove a beta app from devices or remove access for certain users.
guid	1	smth	Please provide us a way via the Dev Center to force the expiration of the beta app for all, or for certain users.
guid	0	smth	When I turn off the setting->screen autorotation,I find that this function is still enable in the setting->about phone.
guid	0	smth	Since many devs these days use consider only WebKit while developing mobile websites these websites do not render good using IE(which uses Trident isn't much HTML5 compliant).
guid	0	smth	It degrades browsing quality and I'm unable to create a new browser which can fix this issue.
guid	0	smth	UC Browser and IE10 are already there but they use Trident and are hopeless while browsing most of the websites that use vendor specific prefixes and non-standard code.
guid	0	smth	AnTuTu results show and score only 2D graphics and the whole system (as it is all 2D) gets rendered really well and almost lag-free.
guid	0	smth	Apart from these, a game like Asphalt 8 has almost the same lag as Minion Rush does, while those two are quite much different.
guid	0	smth	From these, I concluded that a big part of 3D rendering might be a burden upon CPU, while GPU does not do much.
guid	0	smth	Is that right?
guid	1	smth	Add podcasts as new data resource in windows phone studio app website.
guid	1	smth	there should be mechanism that code can read installed apps.
guid	0	smth	Change country on dev center account.
guid	0	smth	Cant believe this isnt possible.
guid	1	smth	If you wont let me change the country, at least let me close my account and recreate it!
guid	0	smth	A simple component and plugin can be design to bring forth data to Windows Phone from our web pages rather on WordPress or Joomla instead of using RSS feeds.
guid	1	smth	Popular forums, like Kuenna for Joomla and stand alone forums should be allowed.
guid	1	smth	User and passwords sync should be allowed as well for participation.
guid	1	smth	Add coloured backgrounds
guid	1	smth	I'd like to feed crash reports straight into my bug tracker.
guid	0	smth	Right now, there's no easy way to automate their download and parsing.
guid	1	smth	An HTTP-based API with a program-friendly logon (e. g. OAuth) would be most welcome.
guid	0	smth	I love one note because of its fast cross platform sync, i feel when i am on a call and want to take notes, adding a button in the dialer (Loudspeaker, mute, hold, add call.. ) to open OneNote will help me open it easily.
guid	0	smth	When it is opened from a call, then OneNote can get information on the call details (Person who is on call, time etc) which would enable easier understanding.
guid	0	smth	Similarly this idea could be thought through for integration of One Note with other Native applications like Camera, Messaging etc
guid	1	smth	I want to be able to control the balance of the audio I play back with the BackgroundAudioPlayer.
guid	1	smth	There is no good reason for not allowing this, so please add it.
guid	1	smth	Allow Microsoft.Phone.ScheduledTask.
guid	1	smth	start at the specified time!
guid	0	smth	facing problem while I open my app.
guid	0	smth	It opens ad then close.
guid	0	smth	The build in WP8 LongListSelector will jump to the last item added, when data loading.
guid	0	smth	When used in combination with MVVM and sorted data, this will result in the fact that the LLS is positioned at the bottom of the list when all data is available.
guid	0	smth	We now need to add extra code to reposition it at the top, after it has been loaded.
guid	1	smth	In my application some data required to save on disk, There is limited storage in Phone memory, I just need api to write or create files folder wise on external memory like memory card..
guid	1	smth	Add right to left orientation for text and pages support in windows phone studio app website.
guid	0	smth	This would provide much powerful photo apps for real time shutting and photo editing.
guid	1	smth	I want to have access to all single bytes within picture, so I can do with those bytes whatever I want.
guid	0	smth	poder guardar aplicaciones en skydrive y poder ejecutarlas seria una funci__n __nica de los windows phone.
guid	0	smth	Ejecutarlas a pesar de no tener conexi__n a una red
guid	0	smth	Native video player and support for subtitle If I am right the native video player doesnt support subtitle file (.srt).
guid	0	smth	It would be real help in increasing user experience
guid	0	smth	It is a common scenario for the user to initiate a network transfer, then turn off the screen or switch to another app while the transfer is still in progress.
guid	1	smth	Apps should get at least 60 seconds of background processing time to complete such network transfers and process the response.
guid	0	smth	I'm aware that the Background Transfer Service is available, but there are cases where this is not usable, because it requires the data to be transferred to be written to temporary files in the storage.
guid	0	smth	This is also a capability that other mobile platforms have, and I think it is needed to build quality apps with a good user experience.
guid	0	smth	I completely understand the need for restrictions on background processing to help preserve battery life and responsiveness, but Windows Phone is currently too restrictive.
guid	0	smth	This is also a capability that other mobile platforms have, and I think it is___ more
guid	1	smth	It would be very useful to be able to prepair a MMSComposeTask, in the same way that we today could use the SMSComposeTask .
guid	0	smth	Being able to prepare an MMS for the user would have many usages, and the functionality are readily available on other platforms.
guid	1	smth	It would be really good to add parallel linq in windows phone and portable class libraries for collection processing unification and efficiency.
guid	0	smth	Ssh+ SSL https and some other protocols for vpn tuneling whole device we need
guid	0	smth	The low-end phone with less storage but with the SD are really diffused, but the limit of the data that can't be stored in SD is awful.
guid	0	smth	With the app on SD the device can be better ;)
guid	1	smth	Make Ussd Codes Running on Windows Phone With Os Version 7.8
guid	0	smth	To use the search button for any application in order to avoir to add everytime a custom search functionality
guid	0	smth	When a phone is reset or replaced, restoration o__ installed apps in quite cumbersome.
guid	1	smth	The Store lists purchase history, but a) re-installation must be done one by one and b) the list doesn't indicate which apps have been removed e.g.
guid	1	smth	Would be cool to have an app (or even better, a command in the Store app) that saves a list of currently installed apps (after each Install / Uninstall) so, that the user can re-install all the apps as easily as updating of a number of apps takes place now.
guid	0	smth	After finishing the call.it doesn't show the call history about how much time it we talked .
guid	0	smth	In the dashboard, when you are uploading images in the app description, it does not work for me as I'm 100% sure there's a timeout implemented in the uploading code.
guid	0	smth	I can upload the smaller promotional images fine, but the larger sceenshot pngs will not upload.
guid	0	smth	Yes my internet upload speed is slow, but the site should function for slow upload speeds also, why not.
guid	0	smth	The same goes for the app uploading itself, a larger timeout is there, but there is still a timeout that assumes a reasonably fast upload speed, which not everyone has.
guid	0	smth	Everyone in the USA has nice upload speeds possibly, but not worldwide, and I presume Microsoft would wish to enable developers from other countries also to be able to use their dev center.
guid	1	smth	Just remove the timeouts completely or at least increase all timeouts by a factor of at least 5 - its not a big deal to implement.
guid	0	smth	Everyone in the USA has___ more
guid	0	smth	the reminder function in the wp8 calendar must be expand to more weekly options.
guid	0	smth	1 week, 2 weeks, 3 weeks, 4 weeks, up to 12 weeks from a selected day.
guid	0	smth	I hope you understand me.
guid	0	smth	I'm German and my English is not so good.
guid	0	smth	My problem is, I can use any calendar app, but the function goes back to the base calendar.
guid	0	smth	often I have to make dates that returns 4 weeks on Friday or two weeks on Wednesday.
guid	0	smth	In my old Android calendar is it no problem but in my wp8 is it not possible.
guid	0	smth	best regards and a happy new year Karsten Klein from Germany the reminder function in the wp8 calendar must be expand to more weekly options.
guid	0	smth	best regards and a___ more
guid	0	smth	A shared key chain to share data between the apps, this help in apps with features like SSO
guid	0	smth	Invariably, some users resort to posting negative reviews which actually are questions to the developer that the developer can not answer directly because of the 1-way nature of the Reviews.
guid	1	smth	"I would like to see a simple change to the ""Rate and Review page"" near the bottom."
guid	1	smth	"Just add a small text blurb like ""If you are experiencing problems with this application, please consider sending feedback instead"" along with a link to launch an email to the support email address."
guid	1	smth	To go 1 step further, making the support email process anonymous would probably convince more people to use the support system.
guid	0	smth	Set up a brokerage system, whereby the developer never sees the users live email address, and instead replies to a proxy email set up per-user.
guid	0	smth	To go 1 step further, making the support email process anonymous would probably convince more people to use the support___ more
guid	1	smth	Allow screen capture to be taken from background task OR through mdm protocol.
guid	0	smth	This is useful for techs using mdm systems - for example if a user has an issue and calls their tech support, they can request a screen capture and help them resolve.
guid	1	smth	Implement a free app of the week deal like apple does with ios
guid	1	smth	Create a SubClass of Panel that allows AbsolutePositioning of it's children, yet honours the layout bounds imposed by it's own parent, unlike Canvas which is unlimited in Size and must be clipped to stop the overflow of any children

guid	1	smth	We need override base keyboard, with adding custom keys.
guid	1	smth	And adding new text function: add text from reading QR-code.
guid	1	smth	"On the keyboard near the space button, add new button ""input from camera""."
guid	0	smth	If you push this button, start camera app and starting search QR-code.
guid	0	smth	Full support for the Applr Earpods
guid	0	smth	It is nearly impossible to edit videos recorded by the phone on the isolated storage, it shouldn't be this hard.
guid	0	smth	One has to write its own libraries simply to encode and decode videos and access the frames, let alone manipulate them and do something useful.
guid	0	smth	Even with native code support on WP8 it is very time consuming to port existing libraries to do this.
guid	1	smth	I think it would be much easier to just provide APIs for the hardware encoder/decoder to edit videos on isolated storage (and with better performance)
guid	0	smth	"A collegue of mine , with an Android Smartphone has just showed me on this Phone an Android Launcher called --> ""Launcher 8"" https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lx.launcher8 What I saw was a Windows Look and Feel and much, much more functionality than my Windows 8 Nokia Lumia has."
guid	0	smth	And when I say much more , I mean much more.
guid	0	smth	Summa sumarum: Buy Launcher 8 or give us a way to customize the user Experience ourselves.
guid	0	smth	Some of our use cases require geofences e.g.

guid	0	smth	The existing PubCenter (or Bing Ads ) performance on Windows Phone is very poor.
guid	1	smth	Indie Developers need a better performing Advertising Team and Ad control.
guid	1	smth	Can Microsoft take Advertising support seriously, and provide world wide Ad promotion and delivery.
guid	0	smth	As it is, Indie Developers have lost confidence in Microsoft efforts in PubCentre/Bing Ads and are moving to different Ad controls, and investing into Android and iOS Platforms until Microsoft starts to demonstrate that it is serious about providing revenue performant Adversting services.
guid	1	smth	We would like a WiFi CSP so we can configure users WiFi - this is useful from an IT tech user perspective.

guid	0	smth	Regardless of votes group or technical people should check them regularly for ideas and bundle them together in a service pack....

guid	0	smth	ability to lock Default media hub and Office hub using password...
guid	0	smth	Profiles like Office, Meeting, Outdoors or Night have proven useful and apps like Situations made them automatic.
guid	0	smth	Sure profiles would attract many Nokia users to WP products.
guid	1	smth	Please provide full access to the ContactStore, eg, updating, deleting etc.
guid	0	smth	Also if I create a contact in the ContactStore then search contacts it returns the ones ive created, but there is no extended properties that will enable me to know ive created it in my custom store.
guid	1	smth	So please provide this extra info in the Contact data returned with a search.
guid	1	smth	Can you please provide a report viewer control to view SSRS reports in windows phone.
guid	0	smth	Always says the URL is invalid, yet the URL works.
guid	1	smth	I think that would be useful if we can get the number of reviews and avarage rating by country in the Dev Center Report.
guid	0	smth	Sometimes reviews can be for previous versions of the app.
guid	0	smth	This can lead to some confusion about complaints in the reviews and whether they were fixed or not.
guid	0	smth	Many times I've read reviews for apps and decided to not get it because I was unsure whether it was listened to and fixed or not.
guid	0	smth	iOS has this implemented in their store and I believe it works great.
guid	0	smth	If its not a legal issue, I firmly believe this needs to be implemented in the Windows Phone store.
guid	0	smth	hope you all able to update the Facebook Apps for Window 8 ,, as the chat room ( message ) not able to download file attachment like Words, Excel ... to maximize the utility of Microsoft Office usage, you all should included the function of downloading file attachment to allow user like me to have wide rage of office usage..
guid	1	smth	The Windows Phone emulator should include the ability to manage VM snapshots for Windows Phone images.
guid	1	smth	Developers should be able to create WP images that are tailored to be in a specific state, and manage those image snapshots.
guid	0	smth	Hyper-V is a powerful VM management tool, and it includes the ability to create new images and manage snapshots within them, allowing developers to save the current state of the VM (e.g., to manage particular testing scenarios such as upgrading the app when a good amount of custom data is in it, either for one app or multiple) or to roll the state back to a prior checkpoint marked in the VM.
guid	1	smth	Emulator image tooling should be expanded to include the following: - Create a new developer VM image (from one of the base images) - Delete a created developer VM image - Be able to add/remove developer VM images from the Visual Studio device/emulator list - Additional tooling in the emulator to allow for snapshot management of developer VM images Under this suggestion, the developer should be unable to manage or modify the base/standard images, this suggestion is only for adding additional images.

guid	1	smth	I would like to have an option for each SkyDrive folder, to make them available offline.
guid	0	smth	Because not everywhere in the countryside or even in cities a good network connection is available.
guid	0	smth	So those folders could be downloaded completely to the phone when a Wi-Fi is available to access them offline later.
guid	0	smth	Hi, Instead of writing elaborate SyncML services, I would like to do the same using push notification like what is happening in iOS.
guid	0	smth	We can still have DM client and the DM client can react to push messages provided the device is enrolled.
guid	0	smth	Push Notification Free Options like GCM [Google cloud message]
guid	0	smth	It is imperative for certain apps that some form of persistent background connectivity be allowed.
guid	0	smth	I appreciate the need reducing wastes of battery power, but if Microsoft believes in putting the user in control, then allow the user to enable access to persistent TCP connections on an app by app basis as Windows 8 allows.
guid	0	smth	Inefficient apps can then be disallowed by the user, while still enabling experienced developers the flexibility to offer apps for legacy protocols that can't be converted to a push notification system, among other users.
guid	1	smth	The GZipStream class should be available for Windows Phone developers, so we don't have to rely on 3rd party libraries to compress and decompress streams.

guid	0	smth	Coming from webOS, navigation on wp8 feels very stilted.

guid	0	smth	WCF discovery not supported in Windows Phone.
guid	1	smth	Would be great to discover Service Hosts in local Networks.
guid	1	smth	It will be great to have an option to disable the infinite looping of Pivot and Panorama controls and use them in a similar way like Picture/Article browsing, etc.
guid	0	smth	Having users enroll their phone using the same mdm client no matter the vendor is a nice idea.
guid	0	smth	However, if an IT tech is using the same mdm vendor across all platforms, the enrollment experience is then totally different.
guid	0	smth	We would like to make the enrollment process consistent for our users.
guid	1	smth	Can we have an API to enroll the device through an app, or allow mdm enrollment to initiate through a browser download.
guid	0	smth	The idea of background agents expiring if they have not been 're-initialized' in two weeks makes sense.
guid	0	smth	However, in some scenarios they do not make sense.
guid	0	smth	We have a company hub app that is downloaded after mdm enrollment, this hub app uses a background task to post back some device info and location which is not available through the mdm protocol.
guid	1	smth	There is no user interaction here, so we would like to be able to set the expiry to never for our background tasks in this scenario.
guid	0	smth	The only workaround just now is to keep track of when tasks were set up and send the user a toast to get them to click and activate the app.

guid	1	smth	As a developer, I would like to have method to defer app deactivation/suspending in order to call async methods easily
guid	1	smth	Support a greater variety of Microsoft Media Foundation APIs such as the ones that allow adjustment of pitch and playback speed.
guid	0	smth	Advanced audio APIs would allow developers to create music applications for musicians, etc.

guid	0	smth	There are few websites with 2 letter domain name and IE doesn't store cookies for this domains.

guid	0	smth	In The Class Of Microsoft.Phone.Scheduler.ScheduledTask, there are property BeginTime As Date, but it is not supported!
guid	0	smth	Is it possible to support in the future?
guid	1	smth	I'd suggest to include all Transactions in the Report.
guid	0	smth	or at least distinct records (different taxes, sales Price, date time).
guid	0	smth	Currently an evaluation which Downloads were billed at which Price is not possible.
guid	0	smth	i think it's good that 3th apps can access to the list of installed apps and can decide to unistall or freeze or lock etc...
guid	0	smth	Bing science App will regroup all the news in the world about astronomy biology physics technology etc.
guid	0	smth	The cover of the live tiles will be like a bottle of chemistry sort of.
guid	0	smth	What do you think?
guid	1	smth	It would be good to know not only the number of downloads but also how many are active still.
guid	0	smth	If you have seen the google store they show active installations more prominently than total download count - and that actually makes sense considering the amount of trash apps going around in all the phone o/s .
guid	0	smth	We would like to create an app to monitor the time users spend in other the apps, enabling enterprise customers to optimize a user's day by analyzing time on applications.
guid	0	smth	My original account expired and I was forced to create a new account when I decided to enroll again.
guid	0	smth	However, since the original account is tied to my Microsoft Id (which is used everywhere else!)
guid	0	smth	it is now a pain to log into Dev Center.
guid	0	smth	In fact, how does one do it?
guid	0	smth	When I navigate here I am connected via the expired account.
guid	0	smth	But logging out and back in is no good since I am not asked which account I want to use.
guid	0	smth	Other platforms(android) can play them(touchshow) how does a windows phone not?
guid	0	smth	I was fairly disappointed by this.
guid	1	smth	Voice over PowerPoint should be available on a windows phone as it is already available on the android platform using the touch show add in
guid	1	smth	I'd like to know what rank my app is in each country and category in the app store.
guid	0	smth	It would better allow me to judge the effectiveness of my marketing.
guid	1	smth	Add the ability to see lyrics of music files in the music application for running music
guid	0	smth	Auto rotation of keyboard not working for all apps
guid	0	smth	For example Microsoft's apps separately and Nokia 's apps separately and so on...
guid	0	smth	If you have a password set on your lockscreen, swipe up to show the password keyboard.
guid	0	smth	then dismiss keyboard.
guid	0	smth	now swipe right to log into kids corner instead of regular start.
guid	0	smth	password is required even for kids corner now.
guid	0	smth	This will stay until the parent types in their password.
guid	0	smth	if the kid swipes right correctly at first - then no issue.
guid	0	smth	This makes a hassle when trying to use something that I think is awesome when it does work right.

guid	0	smth	Though Blend has this template.
guid	0	smth	isn't it better to allow developers to change their app name inside app store according to different language and culture?
guid	0	smth	currently it supposes to be reading all names from some dll files in the xap bundle,(if you have support for different languages) but it failed, and the name displayed in app store can actually harm the ranking of the app.
guid	0	smth	creating those dlls is a pain in the xxx .
guid	0	smth	Want to get list of thirdparty apps, to make the phone secured,
guid	0	smth	Any up___dates on the nested virtualization?
guid	0	smth	I want to run the Windows Phone 8 Emulator in a virtual machine, but it failed.
guid	0	smth	Does it mean the nested virtualization is not supported yet?___
guid	1	smth	Provide an automation toolkit to enable developers to walk through a series of steps and take screenshots at relevant points, then re-run those steps in different languages to automate the process of taking screenshots in different languages for app submission.
guid	1	smth	Would also be helpful in it's own right for general localization testing to verify that localized strings have messed up layout.
guid	1	smth	Add new colors
guid	0	smth	Open the customization of the live tile to have a possibility to control the volume of the phone and other thing.

guid	0	smth	Enabling developers to access a the data sent to the device screen for displaying.
guid	0	smth	this feature is very annoying as it keeps changing my words for me and i don't want that.
guid	0	smth	after every 3 words or so my phone will put the first letter into a capitol and words such as go and others it just puts it completely into capitols, this is soo annoying and getting on my nerves, pls fix/allow for more settings for this asap
guid	0	smth	Not all developers care about all emulator images that are displayed in the VS list.
guid	1	smth	An developer should have an option or tool to manage that list, and select which ones are displayed.

guid	0	smth	The team across Development, Support and Business are able to track the progress of app review.
guid	0	smth	This helps in understanding the timeline for publishing the app.
guid	1	smth	Make it possible to optionally declare a function OnClick() for live tiles, such that this code is executed when the live tiles is presed without leaving the home screen.
guid	0	smth	Think about WiFi toggles, music controls, unmute/ mute etc.
guid	1	smth	Please, to have competitive advantage, i would like you to provide an expedite package for app certification for developers who wants their apps to be published fast.
guid	1	smth	I need a way to submit bugs to the engineering team and have them triaged + responded to.
guid	0	smth	Discussion request for commenters: Visual Studio accepts bugs for Windows Phone at https://connect.microsoft.com/VisualStudio/ -- is being able to file WPDev bugs here sufficient?
guid	0	smth	Is Connect sufficient?
guid	0	smth	Please share thoughts.
guid	0	smth	The WiFi analyzer app for android is very useful to IT professionals such as myself.
guid	0	smth	Windows Phone application development should be possible with currently supported Windows versions (e.g., windows 7, vista) and not limited to only the latest Windows version that has limited adoption and hardware requirements.
guid	0	smth	Given that the emulator is virtual anyway, I'm unsure why my development environment is limited in such a way.
guid	0	smth	Limiting the development environment to Windows 8 only limits my ability to develop for Windows Phone, and ultimately will pull down Microsoft.

guid	0	smth	As developer, I don't understand why I need add to all my projects copy of (not very small) Windows Phone Toolkit for effects, which platform already has built-in :/ thank you.
guid	0	smth	All uesr want to find fast their contact when they must call, so it's very good to insert the fast search on phone dialer, it's good that the user can choose the better method to search, like name or/and surname or/and Address etc...
guid	0	smth	On IOS, you can create a twitter aggregation of users and or topics to be shown on one screen.
guid	0	smth	Was looking for some type of function of that.
guid	1	smth	Add Twitter datasource, then add user names to feed it through.
guid	0	smth	Some testers do not understand the criteria for certification.
guid	0	smth	I have a tester who failed my game multiple times, and a supervisor who backed him up, but both are dead wrong as seen from reading their own failure report.
guid	0	smth	The criteria that the game needs to meet is listed right on the fail report: 1) Play a music file.
guid	0	smth	2) Launch the application.
guid	0	smth	3) Verify that while the application loads, it does not pause, resume or stop the actively playing music.
guid	0	smth	"Then here is the reason they list for failing it: ""Select YES when asked to play music, observe that the games music plays simultaneously with the phones music"" By their own reasoning, you can see that my game MET the criteria, by not pausing, resuming, or stopping the music."
guid	0	smth	This tester changed the criteria.
guid	0	smth	What's worse is that his boss, Eric Dunaway, agreed with the tester in his misreading of the criteria.

guid	0	smth	.wma files copied/moved to Music library using MediaLibraryExtensions.SaveSong() API from a windows phone app are stored in Music library with .mp3 extension, though the audio file itself will play properly from Music library When you share it via email - you can notice that file attached has a .mp3 extension Or connect phone to PC with usb cable and browse through windows explorer to Music folder - you will find the file with .mp3 extension.

guid	0	smth	Now that native development is an option, it's very frustrating that one can't debug the native code that's being executed on the device without a real device.
guid	0	smth	Back in the Windows Mobile/CE days, Microsoft had a Device Emulator that would faithfully emulate an ARM CPU and would execute exactly that same code that eventually went to the device.
guid	0	smth	This capability was essential for certain low-level tasks like native crash investigation, debugging stack clobbering scenarios, deep optimization with inline assembly (e. g. for NEON) and such.
guid	0	smth	Now that capability is lost.
guid	1	smth	Please bring it back.
guid	1	smth	Give Some API to find out these thing.Android and IPhone provide API's to find out these thing.And don't give accuses because of security reasons.Android and IPhone is also secure.So work on it and Provide Some API because in Mobile technology it is very difficult to create application without this.

guid	0	smth	Still not supporting Windows 7?

guid	0	smth	I currently I use a wp71 class library to access the fm api's, but these does not provide the means of changing the audio route.
guid	0	smth	The ability to change to audio route for the MediaLibrary would also be great.
guid	0	smth	The build in Music + Video app's fm radio switch to speakerphone is very nice, but when going back and playing music from the media library it switch to the headphones that had to be plugged in to enable the FM radio.
guid	0	smth	That is very inconvenient so it would be great if the audio route is always in sync between the fm radio and media library.

guid	0	smth	I Need this to give the user a Signal he should/can react on
guid	1	smth	Just like the user can select apps that are allowed to run in the background, it would be great if they could select apps that are allowed to change phone settings.
guid	1	smth	For example I would love it if my GPS app could turn location on when the app starts and turn it back off when the app exits.
guid	0	smth	When entering a payment method, there's no option to delete an existing payment method before entering a new one.

guid	1	smth	Allow the phone to be used as a mini presentation device.

guid	0	smth	Bluetooth is almost useless for my lumia 820.
guid	0	smth	Because it can't link with Andriod , IOS , and even WP7
guid	1	smth	Allow us developers to renew our expired subscriptions.
guid	0	smth	Currently, after 30 days of expiration, we can't renew with our original accounts.
guid	0	smth	I've asked the support, they said me that I have to create another subscription with another live account, and after it, ask them to migrate apps and related data.
guid	0	smth	"But he also said that NOT all of the data would be possible to transfer, like ""reporting""."
guid	0	smth	Well, the big deal for me is that I won't to create another account.
guid	0	smth	It's not healthy to keep several accounts that means nothing, specially ones that you just had to create because some service does not allow things like a single renew.
guid	0	smth	After all, it is so easier to just allow to renew than you MS having to work for transfering data from one account to another.
guid	0	smth	I'm delaying the registration and app creation, untill it is possible.
guid	0	smth	I hope it will be!

guid	0	smth	This feature could bring the capability for create better music player to put in the marketplace.
guid	1	smth	Please add option to choose bank country under ___Payment Account_ from list of supported one.
guid	0	smth	Why only have static country of registration there.
guid	1	smth	And please expand the list of supported countries for payouts to PayPal.
guid	0	smth	I have a windows phone app that was recently released.
guid	0	smth	A review was posted and immediately after the same person posted a review with a different star rating.
guid	1	smth	Allow reviews to be updated, or some form of dup check and allow one review per person per app.
guid	1	smth	Developers need to be able to use their MS account to sign into the VS2012 phone emulator.
guid	0	smth	If it is a real account I do not see the problem here?
guid	1	smth	We need to be able to test our applications with other windows apps installed.
guid	0	smth	Why is this disabled?
guid	0	smth	What is the issue here?
guid	0	smth	Mobile banking app for SunTrust bank.
guid	0	smth	Its on ios and Droid but not wp8.
guid	0	smth	My problem related with Windows Phone Developer Account only.
guid	0	smth	Nobody hepls me about this topic in Turkey :( I think it's Microsoft USA's problem :) When Windows Phone Developer Account started, Turkey is not in the list, so I Choose a country for continue.
guid	0	smth	Now, Dev account available in Turkey, but I cant change my Country.
guid	0	smth	Also, when i want open a Windows Store Developer Account , this informations comes with me.
guid	0	smth	"""Thank you for reaching out to Microsoft Windows Phone Developer Support."
guid	0	smth	Turkey being one of the newest opened locations.
guid	0	smth	While we understand your current situation, we cannot change your region once selected.
guid	0	smth	Since changing is not an option, you will need to create a new account within the Turkey region.
guid	0	smth	What we can offer you is the attempt to transfer your apps to the new account.
guid	0	smth	Please note not all requests can be completed.
guid	0	smth	But we can certainly attempt this for you.
guid	0	smth	Since you have mentioned that you are a student account, this might require you to create to simultaneous accounts.
guid	0	smth	Each account must be active.
guid	0	smth	If this is something that you would like to look into, please contact DreamSpark as well.
guid	0	smth	"Currently the option to do so is not present."""
guid	1	smth	Please allow to change country !

guid	1	smth	An API so the Facebook integration features can be expanded upon as well as other social networks added
guid	0	smth	We need to share all our data from our mobile phone or SD card, so we need a file manager on WP...
guid	0	smth	I want to share my music with my friends with whatsapp or any other app...
guid	1	smth	"It would be great if as we have the apps menu to the right of ""home"" we have another menu to the left with notifications and shortcuts or simply the possibility of turn on/off WiFi and other things like the bright, the sound, etc."
guid	0	smth	Textboxes in Windows Phone built-in apps (for instance, in the message hub) allow the user to scroll just by swiping the finger on it.
guid	0	smth	It's imprecise and frustrating, and confuses the user as he's not used to this behavior in system apps.
guid	0	smth	Providing the same scrolling in the Silverlight/WinRT textbox would definitely improve the user experience.
guid	0	smth	In my application that plays MP3's over the internet often when I start a track it stops playing after some time for a second or so and then continues normally.
guid	0	smth	If I download that track and play it in standard player there is no such a glitch.
guid	0	smth	This started happening on my Lumia 820 and 520 phones after GDR2 update.
guid	1	smth	You should be able to select, from a drop-down menu or text box, how much memory is required for your app to run, or select what devices to test for.
guid	0	smth	My apps keep getting rejected because they are being tested on devices that they were not designed for.
guid	0	smth	Other dev sites let you select these options during the submission process.
guid	1	smth	develop application to lock perticuler apps like msg, email, any apps.
guid	0	smth	Currently when using WriteableBitmap or decoding image data you have to do that on the UI thread.
guid	0	smth	This is very problematic since if you need to do any heavy image processing you're slowing the UI and negatively affecting the user experience.
guid	1	smth	It would be great if there were specific classes that could be instantiated on non-ui threads (and then loaded by ui-thread image objects)
guid	1	smth	Extend push/notification/background task api's to allow storage of incoming push notification messages, repeating of a notification as frequently as every 1-2 minutes, repeating the notification indefinitely until cleared by user, ability to specify sounds and volume.
guid	0	smth	Basically I have been attempting to write a pager style alerting application to notifying me of critical IT issues, and the need it to be able to wake me.
guid	0	smth	The currently limitations of api's prevent this type of app.
guid	1	smth	"Bring back ""Local"" in Bing search!!"
guid	0	smth	It is now inefficient chore to find local addresses.
guid	1	smth	Bring back ability to copy/paste addresses from Bing search so people can text each other addresses to meet up at!
guid	1	smth	Add the ability to connect to WindowsShare/Samba servers.
guid	1	smth	Please, add SAP (Sim Access Protocol) Bluetooth protocol.
guid	0	smth	This is required for many built in car hand frees.
guid	0	smth	SAP is superior to only HF as it enables e.g.
guid	1	smth	hey plz give some file manager apps,mx player,swype keyboard...................
guid	0	smth	A panorama template based app will attract more to YouTube than static.

guid	0	smth	- User Configurable - Dynamic configurable for App/Game Developers [Say, F1= Fire, F2=Reload, F7=Secondary Weapon, F3=Cycle Weapons] - F4 = Touch Scroll + Fingerprint Reader It can look ugly... but will be a lot useful for customizing the device in a larg
guid	1	smth	Please unify the Windows Phone (8 / Blue / 9) and Windows (8 / 8.1 / 9) development compleatly!
guid	0	smth	It is good that you started this unification with the common core!
guid	0	smth	But it should be common on all sense not just on general things, but also on UI XAML code!
guid	0	smth	There are a lot of patterns out there and it is not too hard to think yourself a good/new design pattern which unify the UI development for example.
guid	0	smth	It is ok that some things will be awailable on Windows 8/9 devices which are not available on Windows Phone 8 / 9 and vice versa.
guid	1	smth	Please support multi-segment path for this method or at least return a message giving more details.
guid	1	smth	Your app must not contain or display content that a reasonable person would consider pornographic or sexually explicit.
guid	1	smth	Pornographic and sexually explicit needs to be well defined.
guid	1	smth	Furthermore Age Ratings in Dev Center Dashboard can be set per app according to the content in the app.
guid	1	smth	If the app fills out this information there it should not be taken down unless it has pornographic or sexually explicit material which is not well defined in store policies.
guid	1	smth	Would it be too much to ask for an API that wraps whatever mechanism is required to accomplish this?
guid	1	smth	A container for starting applications inside it on Windows 10 IoT Core instead of full-screen.
guid	1	smth	Providing separate x and y factors would enable it to be used on objects without fixed aspect ratios.
guid	1	smth	With separate x and y scale measurements both objects could be resized via pinch/stretch.
guid	1	smth	You can use Wireshark to inspect packets and see that queries having a class of ANY will be answered by a DNS-SD registration from Bonjour but will not be answered by the above DNS-SD registration.
guid	1	smth	And using that string the api may activate the command like cortana does when you say Hey cortana  MY COMMAND but without voice interaction.
guid	1	smth	It would be a huge advantage to support this attribute also on the App-object in the App.xaml-file and to make this the ultimate root.
guid	1	smth	Allow license assignment for an application to be tied to Azure AD group similar to how licenses in Office 365 can be managed.
guid	1	smth	I want to create windows service which runs in background and checks if any bar-code is scanned whenever a bar-code is scanned I want the windows service to handle it and write the input to the text file.
guid	1	smth	Please make the (Fluent) design toolkits available for Affinity Designer.
guid	1	smth	Would be great if setter had Delay property to only execute it after a certain amount of time.
guid	1	smth	It would be great to be able to get the current appointment and the next appointment a user has.
guid	1	smth	add stopwatch controller
guid	1	smth	i want to add clock controller visually to show time
guid	1	smth	Add PrinterController that was in WPF and WinForms.
guid	1	smth	Is there anyway you could make Windbg Preview available for offline downloading?
guid	1	smth	I would like to add Bixby to this list.
guid	1	smth	Why don't build a phone powered by Android but running customized by Microsoft itself.
guid	1	smth	Also if Cortana can read/reply messages from the phone why not link that API or process (not sure if those are the words needed for my idea) to the Messaging app that comes built-in on W10?
guid	1	smth	And also it will be great the Microsoft expands it services internationally like for example Cortana which it barely works in regions outside the US.
guid	1	smth	I hope that Microsoft pay attention to this and do something because I would like to see them making its way in the mobile department.
guid	1	smth	PD: All Microsoft apps should be native on the phone and you should also build up a mobile text messaging app that sync with the messaging app on Windows.
guid	1	smth	Could you please increase the maximum size or better: remove it at all!
guid	1	smth	Because of this I would like the functionality to only execute the SelectedItem code when a row is DoubleTapped.
guid	1	smth	My proposed solution is to add a RowDoubleTapped event directly to the UWP DataGrid class itself.
guid	1	smth	I would like to add a AnimatedHeaderedTextBox control to the Toolkit.
guid	1	smth	Get back the Offiline Symbols download
guid	1	smth	Would it be possible to enhance the loading control to disable navigation when it is running?
guid	1	smth	Most of the screen a wide so why not a horizontal layout for ColorPicker.
guid	1	smth	Upon a person next logging into the device it would be nice to be able to have the app restart automatically too.
guid	1	smth	I'd like to see a way for any UWP app to opt-in to being automatically restarted when the user logs in after a shutdown caused by an automatic reboot.
guid	1	smth	Having the app receive activation parameters that indicate the cause of the restart would be great for this too.
guid	1	smth	It would allow the app/developer to track why the app was restarted but more importantly it would allow for the app to provide a better experience that allows the user to continue where they last left off--with the app running and at a specific position in the app.
guid	1	smth	Nav View should be made a full proof solution for developers.
guid	1	smth	Nav View should be more integrated to the application so that the app is consistent.
guid	1	smth	This info should be mandatory IMHO.
guid	1	smth	It would be great if I could have two WebView each having a different user profile.
guid	1	smth	A command like ms-settings:utilities would be very useful.
guid	1	smth	For example an IsSelected property could be added to a TreeViewNode or a function like selectNode(TreeViewNode) to the TreeView.
guid	1	smth	So ever event handler must be like one touch behaver of user.
guid	1	smth	I think Microsoft should add a new property to FontIcon that combines FontFamily and Glyph into a single Uri Property call it GlyphUri.
guid	1	smth	Further I think nuget should maintain a set of tags on all their properties one of these tags should be Font-Icons so that when you click Download New Font its going to search nuget for this Font-Icon tag and list the packages for fonts from most popular to least popular...
guid	1	smth	Also I think NuGut should maintain User Comments for each package...and a 4 star rating...so that people can get an idea if the package is any good without installing....
guid	1	smth	Could you add the link for the feedback hub to the store's app review form?
guid	1	smth	I believe that the 'app review' and 'report for developers' should be divided.
guid	1	smth	Is it possible to add the note to the review form as following?
guid	1	smth	We need to open the window as maximized.
guid	1	smth	Please provide a way to configure the size of the window in the LaunchUriForResultsAsync method.
guid	1	smth	1) Take sample from here: https://github.com/Microsoft/Windows-iotcore-samples/tree/develop/Samples/SerialUART/CS
guid	1	smth	4) Run application and set breakpoint ReadAsync method after line
guid	1	smth	Ã¨ Microsoft should give us the possibility to download created app packages for failed certification processes for further debugging.
guid	1	smth	Suggestion for Pathicon DataUri Property for loading PathIcon from a Svg File instead of specifying messy vector strings nobody really wanted to put this stuff (F1 M 1612 202L 2016 116) in their xaml.
guid	1	smth	Another possibility is to allow DataUri to point to a text file holding this type of stuff: F1 M 1612 202L 2016 116
guid	1	smth	Would be nice if you could drag your file from the Project Tree over to a Xaml property requiring an ms-appx:/// path and it would expand to an ms-appx:/// path instead of a fullpath to the file on your filesystem?
guid	1	smth	This would be well placed in the task manager Performance tab a dedicated usage graph could be displayed for ML activity.
guid	1	smth	Would be nice if you could set the height of a TextBox using number of Lines.
guid	1	smth	Also HeightLines > 2 should automatically set AcceptsReturn property to true to make it super easy to create a multi-line textbox in XAML.
guid	1	smth	I also think there;s something a little bit weirld about the textbox control if you specify 10 lines height it should say 10 lines in height and not expand box.... it should just beep when you get to the end of the 10 lines... of course it would be line if they built the scrollbars into the control then it would auotmatically scroll when exceeding the 10 lines... but i'll leave that for another complaint after they add a lineheight property... to make it work the way people want it to work....
guid	1	smth	The reason why its a good idea to add a HeightLine property is that it allows everything to be done in XAML setup the FontSize FontFamily and the Pixels size automatically to expand to match exactly 10 lines.
guid	1	smth	From now onward please add Sync() methods first and optionally add supplementary Async() method for long operations.
guid	1	smth	They are a welcome *addition* to the API but they should not be the *only* way to obtain data.
guid	1	smth	It would be good to have an option in xbox device portal so that we can see the javascript console logs like network logs in HTTP monitor tab.
guid	1	smth	Also it would be great if there is an option to inspect and debug.
guid	1	smth	for example I can add some text or anything I please on the side instating how far is this point to the current GPS location
guid	1	smth	I think we should take it one step further and make Notepad opensource like Powershell so the open-source community can continue to add features to Notepad to become the go-to text editor for performing quick edits of programming.
guid	1	smth	It would be useful for Notepad to update from being a win32 app to a UWP one.
guid	1	smth	In keeping with current MS strategy of bringing cross-platform apps to the Windows Store making Notepad one of these would be extremely helpful
guid	1	smth	It would be convenient to have a SelectedBackground property for CalendarView.
guid	1	smth	Please check these links where users discussed similar issue.
guid	1	smth	1) InputPane should not be opened and closed again and again for each input element.
guid	1	smth	2) There should be option of preventing Auto hiding when getting focus through Tab button of InputPane just like PreventKeyboardDisplayOnProgrammaticFocus ( which is also not working in UWP Target Version 16299)
guid	1	smth	Enable 2D application developers to easily use 3D volumetric content in XAML/Composition by configuring spatial scenes and manipulating transforms and skeletal animations.
guid	1	smth	Add a panel that allows to create a design with constraints (and support in Blend)
guid	1	smth	I would like the ability to filter the call stack when trying to trace a function call.
guid	1	smth	Essentially make it as searchable as the solution explorer with the ability to add some exclusion rules
guid	1	smth	Bring WebView with Edge to WPF and WinForms applications
guid	1	smth	and now that i am in my 50's Iam still playing and building but my mother and her friends cant keep up with windows they are having a hard time finding there way around windows please give them back the old windows that they can navigate.
guid	1	smth	Now that Windows 10 has LTE support RCS Messaging API should be introduced so we can take advantage of this messaging protocol in our UWP apps...
guid	1	smth	Hot unplug and wait about 30s
guid	1	smth	Now my idea: All controls could have a default property for localization.
guid	1	smth	An attribute could be used to identify the default localization property for a Xaml Control.
guid	1	smth	It might be placed in a MenuFlyout in a Button in a AppBarButton.
guid	1	smth	Maybe at least if using the simplified FoldDown mode panning other file formats could be supported?
guid	1	smth	In webb for HoloLens Running apps section should have a column that tell the user account under which a app/process is running
guid	1	smth	I would like to ask Microsoft Developers to fix this issue and provide couple extra degrees of freedom going through the RDC.
guid	1	smth	I think we can support this by adding a simple constructor that takes in the same parameters as Initialize.
guid	1	smth	Add LoginHint as optional param to LoginAsync() and plumb through GetUserTokenV2Async.
guid	1	smth	So it would be great to have access to this values to stay on track with actual developments from other vendors.
guid	1	smth	Introduce functionality so that MAC address can be obtained programmatically.
guid	1	smth	Another possiblity is to add an Attribute to Button called:
guid	1	smth	if custom tiles are being displayed get the watermark(s) associated with them).
guid	1	smth	Since we are passing a string via the x:Bind attribute to some UI controls it would be nice if we could make the binding to a ReadonlySpan<T> so we avoid allocations.
guid	1	smth	You could rename the Windows 10 Mobile to Windows 10 Watch and you could stop making the Lumia mobile phones but you could start making Lumia Smartwatch with Windows 10 Watch
guid	1	smth	It needs to work as good as the one available in winmm.dll
guid	1	smth	Please add a semi-automated test queue mode to Driver Verifier where you can select a group of drivers and then have Driver Verifier test them one at a time moving down the queue one position with each reset or reboot.
guid	1	smth	An automated test queue would be wonderful in a situation like this.
guid	1	smth	Please look into how musicians and developers use MIDI and what we would like to be able to do with devices like the Surface and prioritize giving us the ability to innovate here.
guid	1	smth	The SwipeControl control should support mouse input as well as touch input.
guid	1	smth	I personally would like to be able to have a similar arrangement in my own apps but currently am unable to do so.
guid	1	smth	 - resize the windows explorer window to something like 300px to 300px
guid	1	smth	Add an option to let user do so.
guid	1	smth	It might make sense to have that option in Task Manager since it is the tool to control startup tasks in Windows 10.
guid	1	smth	Adding an image editor to CaptureElement control with these options: - Ability to save captured image as predefined image types (.jpg .png...etc).
guid	1	smth	How about an option to automatically delete the automatic checkpoint when the machine starts?
guid	1	smth	Add store uri schema like ms-windows-store://assoc/?AppExt=%q to search app extensions
guid	1	smth	It would be useful if this feature can be supported in Windows 10
guid	1	smth	I want the screen setting to be an option where I can set my preferance as a default.
guid	1	smth	It'd be great if we could chain functions together in x:Bind to create more complex expressions.
guid	1	smth	It would be good if we could submit utility tools to the store as there is no way to perform these tasks without admin.
guid	1	smth	Maybe warn the user when downloading the app or more stringent verification process for these apps but don't block them completely as you're hurting both devs and users.
guid	1	smth	With the publisher in the manifest locked to the developer name as well this should be implemented to make UWP apps much easier to distribute outside of the store.
guid	1	smth	Please improve the app submission process for internal/beta testing:
guid	1	smth	provide a lock to the tiles so that the tiles won't get collapsed accidentally.
guid	1	smth	button to right click and left click in the touchpad of continuum control display in mobile will be very helpful.
guid	1	smth	I have more than 20 apps in the store and would like to see all downloads of these 20 apps as a number.
guid	1	smth	But I hope my suggestion will be passed to where it can be the most helpful.
guid	1	smth	The first feature I wanted to suggest is that I believe Cortana is lacking certain capabilities on Apple iOS; specifically the ability for Cortana to send emails from the Cortana App directly by Outlook for iPhone.
guid	1	smth	Similar to how Cortana handles text messages it would be nice if Cortana could draft an email onto Outlook for the iPhone.
guid	1	smth	The second insight I would like to provide for feedback is on the Cortana's speech recognition on Apple iOS and Android and user input.
guid	1	smth	However I would still appreciate being able to see a text message notification I have received on my iPhone from Cortana.
guid	1	smth	VR is not just wanted for gaming but for business apps too.
guid	1	smth	Suggestion: If the returned StorageFile class could not provide the actual entry of the choices selected by the user maybe the FileSavePicker could do it with a read-only property or method after the user confirmed the file.
guid	1	smth	M$ could try again to develop great software again as many years before which your customers want to install themselves because it's just fun to work with and it brings great benefits to users.
guid	1	smth	The could start with small things like this feedback Form which is annoying too.
guid	1	smth	TrySetWallpaperImageAsync only supports a primary display rather than allowing the wallpaper to be set for any attached displays.
guid	1	smth	Add a 'switch' statement for XAML which allows app developers to modify parts of a layout based on a value.
guid	1	smth	I would like to add the functionality myself or contribut if somebody could help me.
guid	1	smth	I think MS needs to provide more support for schools thinking about cloudbook using Windows 10s.
guid	1	smth	I'd like a user voice where we can request certain software be added to the windows store.
guid	1	smth	I'd like students to be able to install Scratch and Sketchup for example.
guid	1	smth	But it would be good for MS to approach in reverse based on school feedback
guid	1	smth	Update apps same time as IOS and Android updates theirs.
guid	1	smth	2. please set some heat sensing app by default in your Windows before it is too late.
guid	1	smth	Set a multi alarm software so that it can cope coming world situations.
guid	1	smth	Let us make a different type of OS which can understand and not only communicates with the user.
guid	1	smth	It would be extremely helpful if we could create a custom dictionary/word list/constraint as we can already with Speech recognition as it was possible in the old Microsoft.Ink API:
guid	1	smth	Please add windows update to default rules!!
guid	1	smth	Please un-hamstring Windows 10 and support Process Isolation for Containers.
guid	1	smth	Please allow that API in in background.
guid	1	smth	Microsoft should re-enable the Windows Bridge for Android.
guid	1	smth	Get public tweets without user's authentication
guid	1	smth	Take any XAML page add a button to it and bind it to any normal as in not a command on the view model.
guid	1	smth	Compile the app and the Xaml compiler throws the exception.
guid	1	smth	With proper hooks many different scenario variations could be achieved.
guid	1	smth	Let's say there is a app which display news stories.
guid	1	smth	In my opinion developers should not have to do this to prevent multiple unintended events from a control.
guid	1	smth	We need a fix to ensure that the contol stops forwarding click events after it has been clicked multiple times without manually adding code to each and every async handler
guid	1	smth	Closing the StreamSocket (by disposing/deleting it) should stop all the pending asynchronous operations reads or writes.
guid	1	smth	It would be nice it there was an API Discovery endpoint.
guid	1	smth	Adding Visibility property on Expander and making the header Invisible will make the panel looks like it is sliding into the view.
guid	1	smth	Allowing UWP access packaged COM will eliminate this overhead allow simpler architecture and allow re-use much more traditional win32 apps.
guid	1	smth	Hi - you really need to fix the Xbox App store.
guid	1	smth	At the very least publishing on Xbox should be an opt in function when publishing - not an opt out one.
guid	1	smth	It would be nice if you also ported the ads into UWP APIs so that they can be used with Desktop Bridge apps.
guid	1	smth	Please add WMI support on UWP.
guid	1	smth	These APIs ought to be allowed for any UWP application but are most useful when working with runtime code generation:
guid	1	smth	I'd like to see an API to create virtual MIDI ports built into Windows.
guid	1	smth	The Surface touch screen has tons of possibilities as a MIDI controller but this currently requires installing a 3rd party driver which is not a great end user experience.
guid	1	smth	Built in RtpMIDI would be nice too but at least this would be achievable without a kernel mode driver if we had virtual MIDI ports.
guid	1	smth	Allow UWP applications to tick a box in the .appxmanifest declaring it as a full-trust desktop application.
guid	1	smth	If it's an issue virtualize the registry as with the Desktop Bridge.
guid	1	smth	Look the concept of UWP apps can run on your phone (RIP) and your Xbox while admirable isn't practical for most applications.
guid	1	smth	Show a notice to users upon installâ¦ more
guid	1	smth	It would be nice to have an attached property for ScrollViewer to set middle click scrolling.
guid	1	smth	Code would be useful in adapting to Bluetooth applications.
guid	1	smth	Check the Create date on the file.
guid	1	smth	Wait one minute (so the clock shows a new minute) and the run the code again.
guid	1	smth	If you go into the Explorer and delete the file and create it (in explorer) with the same name the create date is correct!
guid	1	smth	Following the comments on the blog post for AF_UNIX it would be nice to see SOCK_SEQPACKET and/or SOCK_DGRAM support.
guid	1	smth	I would like to vote to have this feature be configurable in settings allowing users to disable this feature.
guid	1	smth	Please add support for Cryptuiwiz API to handle timestamp-reply
guid	1	smth	Can't the reason of revocation of extended execution be a little more specific than SystemPolicy (ApplicationClosing ApplicationSuspended...)?
guid	1	smth	In UWP Project follow XAML code make a Win32 Exception when minimum target is build16299.
guid	1	smth	Allow copy&paste in settings pages for path instructions AND especially in Failure/Error outcomes ... for self repair fix research/lookups.
guid	1	smth	It is possible to disable suggestions in the settings but I guess apps should be able to disable this themselves.
guid	1	smth	will be possible to share the roadmap on the LCOW improvment ?
guid	1	smth	Grouping : another optional feature to enable grouping on basis of a string property of the items.
guid	1	smth	Search bar : a top search bar attached to the control which can be enabled/disabled with a boolean property.
guid	1	smth	One of the problems in here is Unity code which is mostly made to be single-instance but it would be great to have support to launch multiple instances of the same app.
guid	1	smth	I'd like to add ItemClick event to the Carousel control to be able to use it as Item listing control with the ability to click on items like in the GridView and ListView.
guid	1	smth	So please remove this restriction.
guid	1	smth	If this is a privacy constraint then please consider to add a capability that can be declared in the app manifest.
guid	1	smth	Based on this it also could notify the user at first app-start like it is done with the camera access.
guid	1	smth	MarkdownTextClock should provide LinkCommand alongside LinkClicked event
guid	1	smth	It would be good if TextBoxRegEx will be automatically delete letters at input like the TextBoxMask.
guid	1	smth	Include the mouse and keyboard support.
guid	1	smth	Make it available for .Net WPF also and via nuget.
guid	1	smth	Please add an overload to create a MediaStreamSample from a D3D Surface.
guid	1	smth	But it would be even better if we could configure the compiler somehow through a special screen in the properties or through an optional configuration file.
guid	1	smth	In such a configuration we could enter for example default binding modes for specific dependency properties like for example TwoWay for TextBox.TextProperty.
guid	1	smth	1) Get rid of the [EmailMessage.Body] character limit.
guid	1	smth	2) If you have such limits publish them in the API docs.
guid	1	smth	3) The aforementioned forum post suggests using a remote API as a work around.
guid	1	smth	Please give developers the option to not participate in the upcoming sets feature.
guid	1	smth	Recommendation: ContentDialog should do the locking so that the user does not have to.
guid	1	smth	To have a dialog that can be used at any time and that always shows centered on the main window of the app you must have two copies of the dialog one embedded in XAML and shown using InPlace but only if it is loaded; and the other not embedded in XAML and shown using Popup.
guid	1	smth	Recommendation: add a parameter to ShowAsync that positions the dialog relative to the main window of the app (centered left right bottom).
guid	1	smth	Since only one ContentDialog can be shown at a time a lock is needed (such as SemaphoreSlim(11) or a sequential queue of TaskCompletionSource).
guid	1	smth	When declaring a custom Template for ContentDialog the template root must contain a Border with x:Name=Container otherwise the ShowAsync method will throw a System.AccessViolationException.
guid	1	smth	So I propose a download archive for Windows Insider Preview SDKs where we can download earlier versions of the Preview SDKs.
guid	1	smth	The expected behaviour is that when you click on the Primary or Secondary button in a ContentDialog then focus should be switched to the button concerned - otherwise x:Bind bindings wont update.
guid	1	smth	Please make registration posible for Moldova.
guid	1	smth	Please extend KeyFrameAnimations/ScalarKeyFrameAnimations to makte them pausable and resumable.
guid	1	smth	In MediaComposition add transitions between two clips on timeline e.g.
guid	1	smth	I think it's good if RotatorTile has an indicator which shows what index is selected or maybe another control that can be attached to RotatorTile.
guid	1	smth	The panorama mode is beautiful and if only we could have a button to call the API from inside our Apps it would be great.
guid	1	smth	That's why I'm suggesting a specialized textbox for numbers.
guid	1	smth	Allow entering negative values
guid	1	smth	Allow entering decimal values
guid	1	smth	Format the text with a specific number of decimal place (i.e.
guid	1	smth	I'm suggesting a textbox with the following feature:
guid	1	smth	It should return DOM element and coordinates and in case of image also the raw bytes.
guid	1	smth	At least receiving ScriptNotify events should be possible on http and without adding ApplicationContentUriRules in Manifest so that we could atleast have a way to do it on our own.
guid	1	smth	Switch the default to LF style line endings in the whole operating system!
guid	1	smth	There are situations where you might want to interrupt navigating away from a page when using NavigationView.
guid	1	smth	Please provide this same information on the 'Usage' page.
guid	1	smth	It would be nice to be able to specify an ItemsSource and automatically populate it with MVVM.
guid	1	smth	In short we need a UWP alternative to ShowcaseView (https://github.com/amlcurran/ShowcaseView)
guid	1	smth	There should be a Machine Learning SDK smilar to Apple CoreML
guid	1	smth	UWP should include a Augmented reality SDK simlar to Apple ARKit and Google AR Dev Kit
guid	1	smth	Could you add this to the list of UWP APIs supported in Desktop Bridge?
guid	1	smth	I really need to be able to programmatically restart my app.
guid	1	smth	Please fix it to support hiding PivotItems correctly especially during data binding when you can't simply add/remove it from the Items collection.
guid	1	smth	Please make ESENT (Jet Blue) technology open source and available on .NET Core and Xamarin for operating systems other than Windows.
guid	1	smth	New control to add multiples tags with close button and auto suggestion functionality.
guid	1	smth	Please add AllAccountsReadWrite to UserDataAccountStoreAccessType in order to allow to creates calendars on remote calendar providers
guid	1	smth	Provide funtionality similar to CurrentAppSimulator class found in Windows.ApplicationModel.Store namespace.
guid	1	smth	Another solution could be simply extend Office Store in order to publish VSTO add-in.
guid	1	smth	Please add reveal effect on each item on the listview in the hamburger menu control as per creators fall update.
guid	1	smth	The possibility to make optional packages plugins with code for in-process with C# and/or VB.net instead of C++.
guid	1	smth	When I make store listings for several languages I would like to be able to just right click on a listing then copy it and edit not .be troubled with details on .cvs and excell.
guid	1	smth	also would like to see when exactly a listing was updated.
guid	1	smth	Please add to UWP BLE API methods to interrogate BLE stack connection settings.
guid	1	smth	You may wish to consider my FlipPdfViewerControl for inclusion in the toolkit.
guid	1	smth	It would be good to see support for setting a GridView inside a ListView which has the ability to add columns.
guid	1	smth	So your are not able to suggest a folder or file to the user by a path-string.
guid	1	smth	What would be helpful is to have a service in the toolkit to get an azure ad token.
guid	1	smth	Having access to the Visibility of the System Back button is good but there are some scenario's where I think it would make sense to have a Disabled state for this button which could be toggled by Dev's in certain scenarios.
guid	1	smth	It would be nice to have a way to automate update/upgrade Bash Ubuntu on Windows 10 that does not require to start Bash.
guid	1	smth	You should update all the constants for the paper sizes for example constant for CR80 or business card and POS receipt paper wasn't stated but you wrote other sizes are being reserved .
guid	1	smth	Please allow generic classes to be base classes of XAML pages/controls.
guid	1	smth	Obviously I would expect in point 3 that neighboring files should still be available (but maybe slightly slower).
guid	1	smth	Allow WinAppDriver to switch context from native to webview.
guid	1	smth	Imagine writing text directly into the TextBox or RichEditBox canvas without the Ink-Keyboard-Overlay.
guid	1	smth	(By the way speech recognition should be handled the same way).
guid	1	smth	So come on all the APIs are already there :) Give Windows Ink a boost.
guid	1	smth	Please make sure the P/Invoke either points to a Windows API allowed in UWP applications or a native DLL that is part of the package.
guid	1	smth	If for some reason your P/Invoke does not satisfy those requirements please use [DllImport(ExactSpelling=true) to indicate that you understand the implicationsâ¦ more
guid	1	smth	Move from OneDrive SDK to Microsoft Graph.
guid	1	smth	Add MSAL support for v2 auth model.
guid	1	smth	Could this not also be provided in the UWP toolkit for inclusion in UWP apps?
guid	1	smth	Add a custom CalendarView control with more personalization options than the one included in the SDK.
guid	1	smth	 - Individual CalendarMonthView control so that if you want to display standalone months you can (maybe you display a grid of 4 months etc)
guid	1	smth	I think in first case must be fired ButtonPressed event too like it happens on phone call.
guid	1	smth	It would be very useful to be able to immediately release the memory held by a UWP BitmapImage (which can be significant for large images).
guid	1	smth	Please make it possible to locate at the other three corners.
guid	1	smth	We need backward compatibility for XAML just like Android for example we can just use NavigationView without any conditional check at all.
guid	1	smth	Please add support for Composition Visual to handle pointer interactions.
guid	1	smth	I would really like to switch to UWP for development however I'm not able to elevate users to install a UWP app that Win32 apps wouldn't have any problem just downloading from a network drive.
guid	1	smth	And also in full screen I would expect transport controls to ignore safe area...
guid	1	smth	Could Microsoft not add a padding reflecting the core window bounds to the full-screen window only instead of manipulating a grid by name?
guid	1	smth	I want the transport controls' semi-transparent areaâ¦ more
guid	1	smth	Add Tumblr Service Too
guid	1	smth	We could also be able to start tracking packages directly too.
guid	1	smth	Consider a full screen application where you'd like to temporarily control that brightness.
guid	1	smth	Please extend the API to run on desktop and mobile devices not in embedded mode.
guid	1	smth	It would be better if it was as fast as the WebClient class used in a desktop application
guid	1	smth	Both problems could be solved by adding GroupStyle.ItemTemplate.
guid	1	smth	And virtualization could be optimized as well by using container cache per group.
guid	1	smth	imagine a image viewer where you have one group Folders and one group Images.
guid	1	smth	Folders must of course use a very different item template than Images.
guid	1	smth	I want to see a better Windows Store first where my apps can be found.
guid	1	smth	Please give the highest priority to improve App Discoverability in Windows Store.
guid	1	smth	Apps must be found by keywords.
guid	1	smth	It would make sense that the app be published to the private store and users who have not been allocated a license should have the ability to request a license rather than just getting an error message.
guid	1	smth	Add a control that reminds users to rate your UWP app after a certain amount of time or app launches.
guid	1	smth	Depth tests are needed for fast skipping occluded pixels and depth reads in the shader are needed for calculating particle opacity (to make them soft).
guid	1	smth	 set depth writes enabled or disabled set other state changes make the draw call
guid	1	smth	In my opinion the D3D11_DSV_READ_ONLY_DEPTH is really useless and should be removed any state validation for reading and writing to the depth texture should just check for D3D11_DEPTH_STENCIL_DESC.DepthWriteMask in each draw call.
guid	1	smth	However to don't sacrifice performance those validation checks should be performed only in debug mode D3D->SetExceptionMode(D3D11_RAISE_FLAG_DRIVER_INTERNAL_ERROR) and in that case the draw call should still be allowed but it only should issue a debug warning: writing to depth and reading from it in the shader may produce undefined results
guid	1	smth	You should trust the application to let it manage the correct state changes on its own without introducing artificial limitations and sacrificing performance.
guid	1	smth	This would result in smaller memory usage faster performance smaller cpu overhead / power usage longer battery life.
guid	1	smth	You will don't have to do these checks if this artificial requirement is removed from DX11 API.
guid	1	smth	Add ability to conditionally trigger a keyframe animation from an expression animation in order to support more complex animation scenarios.
guid	1	smth	Cam'on we need a service status page with we have issue we're working on.
guid	1	smth	We already have the PullToRefreshListView in the toolkit so we can also integrate this functionality into the control and change the name to something more suitable like ListViewEx and have both of the functionality in a single control.
guid	1	smth	Please make the control usable in an app.
guid	1	smth	Make a menu with information about the files being locked by an application
guid	1	smth	It would save a tons of space to only have one small SVG for a simple icon rather than a dozen large png files.
guid	1	smth	Add eyedropper ability to pick color outside of the UWP app.
guid	1	smth	There should be a form developers can fill out to request expedited review.
guid	1	smth	It would be useful if this limitation were removed allowing physical web support to be developed using windows alone without requiring additional hardware resources to publish beacons.
guid	1	smth	For my work app we wanted the app to launch maximised.
guid	1	smth	Allow app to launch URI with http schema in default video or audio player (not only store player win32 apps support will be great).
guid	1	smth	What would be really helpful is to provide an event (maybe something like DirectManipulationCompleting) that would fire as soon as the pointer is released (e.g.
guid	1	smth	Allow to register Background Tasks to be registered when die App is first installed from store or side-loaded without having the need to start the app first.
guid	1	smth	We need something like an InstallationTask.
guid	1	smth	Allow their to be faster response times for contacting App Store after submitting feedback link found at the bottom of the certification report after having your app rejected.
guid	1	smth	In Japanese input the font style should be applied to the left character.
guid	1	smth	It'd be great if the Slider control could have a TickOffset property to make the tick marks not start at the left-most edge of the control.
guid	1	smth	Allow us to withdrawal the money because we don't know when we can reach the threshold USD 200.
guid	1	smth	This can be really helpful if you want to easily create a Multi-Lingual Cortana Experience if you use RESW.
guid	1	smth	So we hope that UWP Image control and ImageSource can support more and more pixelformat like as WPF .NET Framework.
guid	1	smth	Example Page: (App1 should be configured to use Dark theme)
guid	1	smth	To recreate paste the below XAML into a blank page and run (be sure the app is configured to use Dark theme).
guid	1	smth	Accessing this information through an API would be useful for creating automated KPI reports.
guid	1	smth	As a Windows developer I would like the site to be improved to give a reasonable performance.
guid	1	smth	Create new user control with ability to selecte date and time something similar to https://wpftoolkit.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=DateTimePicker&referringTitle=Home in WPFToolkit
guid	1	smth	Please add HeaderedContentControl to the community toolkit.
guid	1	smth	Would like to see the possibility to add a search bar to the master details view that filters results in the master pane.
guid	1	smth	Download.GetPercentage to get the download compleated percentage so that it can be used for creating ProgessBar
guid	1	smth	Should support Background Download
guid	1	smth	Allow the WebView to display URI from the application's local folder.
guid	1	smth	Raise single events (but it's bad for performance)
guid	1	smth	Raise reset event
guid	1	smth	e.NewItems but simple pick the first one.
guid	1	smth	So please allow UWP apps without .NET Native!
guid	1	smth	I wish the InterstitialAd will have built-in animation at least a fade-in effect when it shows.
guid	1	smth	A better option would be to add a new ROLE option for the accounts to indicate which accounts can raise support issues.
guid	1	smth	It just needs the /context command that returns the current context name which could be hard-coded as NATIVE_APP.
guid	1	smth	It would be nice if the driver returns correct size and position so that I don't have to guess and click through the tree to find an element.
guid	1	smth	User should be able to style the Carousel items like we do for ListViewItems/ListBoxItems.
guid	1	smth	User should be able to write style for all the ViewState like Focused Selected UnSelected Normal etc.
guid	1	smth	We need a way to save documents generated and populated within our apps to PDF or XPS.
guid	1	smth	It would be nice if there were an option somewhere where you could reboot your system straight into the BIOS menu.
guid	1	smth	Please can someone implement this line of code and let me know if if is already working?
guid	1	smth	Add shadow option to XAML UI Elements.
guid	1	smth	Please add BTHPROCO_L2CAP to allow us to use a lower implementation...
guid	1	smth	Could you add support of Xamarin.Forms to the Project Rome SDK?
guid	1	smth	So please before you completely remove SuppressSystemOverlays make sure there's a way for us to force the status bar on and off even when we have entered full screen mode.
guid	1	smth	With SuppressSystemOverlays you can still force the status bar to show using StatusBar.ShowAsync.
guid	1	smth	Please provide with more information or planschedule.
guid	1	smth	Release the SharedUserCertificates for individual developers
guid	1	smth	trigger animation based on scroll position or percentage while we scroll/pan in UWP (C#) like many web ui component as superscrollrama.js
guid	1	smth	Since something like this would pretty much be aligned with the whole motion theme of the Fluent Design System I think it would be great if you could support it in future builds so we could use it with other Composition APIs to add new visual details and effects to our apps that are not possible at the moment.
guid	1	smth	bring RIP Silverlight deepzoom control to UWP control and pivotviewer too with win2D capabilities
guid	1	smth	My suggestion/idea is to reduce the development time & effort needed for ASP.NET web application.
guid	1	smth	Typical problem here would be deployment(Installationupdate) of the UI application to client machine But if we simplify this process of deployment like having the rules that the UI app should be only one obfuscated executable file It should not depend on reference libraries.
guid	1	smth	This UI should get loaded on client machine as the user types in url in windows10 task-bar which has the search boxthus removing the dependency on browser for web applications.
guid	1	smth	The downloaded application should not be taking much space on user machine and it should not require installation and it should not require user to double click open but it should open as the user types the url in the search box in task-bar.
guid	1	smth	This UI application should have pure UI logic with all xaml files instead of html to support running on all devices and all OS (linuxwindows 10 onwards).
guid	0	smth	It seems StorageFolder.CreateFolder does not support multi-segment path.
guid	0	smth	Windows.System.RemoteSystems.RemoteSystem does not provide meaningful data for Xbox.
guid	0	smth	And checking GetCapabilitySupportedAsync is always false for any known capability.
guid	0	smth	When adding a StatusFilter for Available Xbox is never shown.
guid	0	smth	This makes it very hard to know upfront if the user can actually launch an URI on Xbox - because it's totally unclear whether Xbox is currently running or applications are allowed to run remotely.
guid	0	smth	Nevertheless if Xbox is running and I use the RemoteLauncher the app is at least started correctly.
guid	0	smth	The state is always Unknown (when the watcher triggers Added or Updated event).
guid	0	smth	using send to compressed ZIP folder with files > 4GB outputs non-ISO-21320-1:2015-conforming files which results in errors in many unzip softwares including 'unzip' reference implementation from info-zip.org as well as 7zip libarchive libzip and others.
guid	0	smth	From the build 17711 Windows.ApplicationModel.AppService.AppServiceConnection.OpenAsync() consistently returns 'Unknown Error'.
guid	0	smth	I've tried this sample but not a luck.
guid	0	smth	The unknown error also happens on build 17713 and I'm curious is this just a bug or will this feature stop on future windows release?
guid	0	smth	Windows Store Policy for Adult Content:
guid	0	smth	Microsoft support working for Report App are taking down apps which have partial but no nudity.
guid	0	smth	Game of Thrones is on the Windows Store and contains full frontal nudity and graphic  scenes so it is quite ridiculous when apps are removed that have partial nudity or body parts blurred out or covered.
guid	0	smth	Windows Store Policy for Adult Content
guid	0	smth	Partial nudity is not pornographic nor sexually explicit.
guid	0	smth	Note that a Windows Forms implementation probably won't work because of deep-seated incompatibilities in the Windows Forms architecture.
guid	0	smth	A WPF-only solution is enough for me however.
guid	0	smth	It is currently officially impossible to display the acrylic window-background effect in a non-UWP window.
guid	0	smth	Several developers have managed to coax out the private API used to implement this feature in a desktop app (see <https://withinrafael.com/2018/02/01/adding-acrylic-blur-to-your-windows-10-apps-redstone-4-desktop-apps/>); however this API is officially unsupported can change at any time and has been changed in a backwards-incompatible manner once in the past.
guid	0	smth	With the new Windows UI Library now in pre-release.
guid	0	smth	Are there plans to ensure new controls will be listed in the Toolbox alongside the OS based standard controls?
guid	0	smth	Will dragging from the toolbox automatically add the using markup to the page?
guid	0	smth	Will the Blend features like isolated Template editing be working?
guid	0	smth	Consistency could be ruined if every dev needs to handle manual markup especially as the UI Toolkit iterates in the future.
guid	0	smth	Will the compact mode resource dictionary be bundled with the nuget package so it can be referenced in the app resources without having to ask developers to copy and paste XAML files.
guid	0	smth	Currently the ManipulationDelta event args provides a single scale factor for pinch/stretch events.
guid	0	smth	It's awkward to have different means of resizing objects.
guid	0	smth	Text boxes on the other hand have little handles attached to use for resizing.
guid	0	smth	A DNS-SD service registration does not respond to mDNS queries having a class of ANY but only responds to queries having a class of IN.
guid	0	smth	Do stuff now that the service is registered.
guid	0	smth	I have seen api recording and streaming and previewing the capture from the video.
guid	0	smth	Offcourse the api can throw CommandNotFoundException.
guid	0	smth	Currently it is unavailable in Israel and can't compliment my already installed Office and OneDrive apps
guid	0	smth	CharacterCasing has been added to the platform but it seems to only be used on editable text controls.
guid	0	smth	Today we have the x:DefaultBindMode attribute to define the default binding mode generated for a compiled data binding created with x:Bind.
guid	0	smth	Currently I can assign a license to all members of a group but it isn't kept up to date.
guid	0	smth	I have a bar-code scanner attached to my windows machine USB port.
guid	0	smth	Probably through a direct draw surface(s).
guid	0	smth	Without this information it will not be worthwhile for me to pursue the creation of a virtual reality system and with this information I can get the job done in a few days.
guid	0	smth	now it's readonly
guid	0	smth	Windbg Preview Available for Offline Downloads
guid	0	smth	When typing in the What's New text area a message Release notes canât be more than 1500 characters with a red (X) glyph appears when you reach 1458 characters.
guid	0	smth	There is no actual error and submission completes.
guid	0	smth	Yellow exclamation?
guid	0	smth	one keychain( Bluetooth chip inserted in a keychain for Dynamic Lock to pair) included with software purchase and the option to purchase multiple key-chains for each user.
guid	0	smth	Windows 10 64-bit Each window does not have Max/Min buttons at the upper left hand corner for user functionality.
guid	0	smth	10 point touch interface only in some applications gestures not functioning and no exit button to reach local environment.
guid	0	smth	I understand this is an Asus and Microsoft concern and hope this evaluation helps in the next update.
guid	0	smth	At Build 2018 support between Cortana and Alexa was announced.
guid	0	smth	I have built an app that targets Windows 8 and the customer is looking for a servicing fix on Windows 8.
guid	0	smth	I have got the fix ready but in order to produce a fix I need to be able to compile with the Microsoft Advertising SDK for Windows 8 (Xaml).
guid	0	smth	Is there anywhere I can find a copy and download it?
guid	0	smth	I have included code to reproduce the issue:
guid	0	smth	The issue seems to be somewhere in Windows.UI.Xaml.dll!TextBlockViewHelpers::AdjustPositionByCharacterCount().
guid	0	smth	Is not news that Window mobile won't have a chance against the major OSs out in the market so I was thinking why try to implement something new when what is out there can be used for good on Microsoft side?
guid	0	smth	So this I have been thinking so far:
guid	0	smth	Microsoft have a good amount of apps on the Google Play Store.
guid	0	smth	They have a great launcher Cortana Outlook Office for mobile and so on.
guid	0	smth	How many consumers runs W10 on their PCs or laptops?
guid	0	smth	The ApplicationViewMode CompactOverlay (also known as Picture-in-Picture Mini-Mode or Always-on-top) for UWP apps has a maximum window size which seems to be a square with sides of approximately half screen height.
guid	0	smth	Is there a good reason for this somehow arbitrary limit?
guid	0	smth	It's mini mode has exactly the same limitation.
guid	0	smth	Other than our product manager said 500 pixels are a good maximum width and height for something called compact
guid	0	smth	Previously it was possible to add an EventSetter to the DataGridRows' style (As mentioned here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22790181/wpf-datagrid-row-double-click-event-programmatically) but since EventSetter is now not apart of UWP I am left without this functionality.0
guid	0	smth	This already exists with the ListView class which has a similar ItemClicked event as an alternative to SelectionChanged.
guid	0	smth	This can become inefficient and somewhat confusing when users are able to select more than one items.
guid	0	smth	This is helpful for layout debugging.
guid	0	smth	Suppose Windows is misbehaving.
guid	0	smth	Suppose I want this to happen under program control.
guid	0	smth	Suppose I want it to be absolutely certain the video has not been monkeyed with.
guid	0	smth	I can add only a style + behavior or create a custom control for it.
guid	0	smth	What do you prefer?
guid	0	smth	Could someone answer my question please?
guid	0	smth	The Windows Bridge does not create a correct output files.
guid	0	smth	I disabled the AV the result is unsucceesful.
guid	0	smth	What would I do?
guid	0	smth	It looks like the bridge cannot remove its own folder while cleaning up the environment.
guid	0	smth	I made a UWP app with a ListView (using KeepLastItemInView).
guid	0	smth	On many systems (probably the slower ones) the scrolling behavior is very odd.
guid	0	smth	Using the touchpad/mousewheel the scrollbar starts moving but not the contents of the ListView.
guid	0	smth	I need to drag the scrollbar using the mouse to go the bottom/top of the ListView.
guid	0	smth	This behavior is not consistent.
guid	0	smth	On other systems is works as expected.
guid	0	smth	So they get stuck in all the networks' devices' cache and never go away.
guid	0	smth	I have found other reports of people around the internet who have struggled with the same bug e.g.
guid	0	smth	I filed one against a Microsoft example on Github here:
guid	0	smth	I am using Microsoft's DNS-SD which aims to implement the Zeroconf standard RFC 6763. https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6763
guid	0	smth	I got nearly everything working except the case of finding all service types on the network using the service type _services._dns-sd._udp on the local domain.
guid	0	smth	This is really useful for making debugging tools such as making a Service Discovery browser.
guid	0	smth	I get no results when I try plugging _services._dns-sd._udp.
guid	0	smth	You can see this for the summary on this feature here or in the RFC.
guid	0	smth	For comparison I've tested this on Bonjour Avahi and Android's Network Service Discovery and they all handle this case correctly.
guid	0	smth	First is there any way to get this to work?
guid	0	smth	I'm using the Microsoft example found here:
guid	0	smth	(find all service types) does not work.
guid	0	smth	For comparison I'veâ¦ more
guid	0	smth	That was a very good build.
guid	0	smth	Template 10 has a Loading (Busy) page that has this functionality.
guid	0	smth	The existing color picker have a very long height.
guid	0	smth	I know this will be simple just edit the style but I can't make it right
guid	0	smth	When dropping appx bundles onto the drop target the page takes a long time to respond.
guid	0	smth	Because the page doesn't change to reflect the drop operation was successful I inadvertently drop multiple packages onto the target wasting my time and bandwidth.
guid	0	smth	Despite being built to appear as a single-page app clicking pretty much any link in Dev Dashboard will result in an entire reload of the page to include navigation bars and columns.
guid	0	smth	This behavior makes quick health checks and submissions nearly impossible.
guid	0	smth	I now avoid logging in until absolutely required.
guid	0	smth	I can't delete or hide them in the dashboard.
guid	0	smth	This eats up screen real estate and impacts load times.
guid	0	smth	I contacted support and they can't delete them either (SRX1418420784ID)
guid	0	smth	As a developer that has to stay on top of feedback I receive feedback from users around the world.
guid	0	smth	I cannot delete this feedback.
guid	0	smth	This clutters up my feedback interface and impacts load times.
guid	0	smth	I contacted support and they can't delete it either SRX1428283722ID
guid	0	smth	As a developer I manage customer groups for package flighting and customer segmentation.
guid	0	smth	When I'm done using a Customer Group I cannot delete or hide it.

guid	0	smth	When a machine automatically reboots as part of installing updates any running apps are closed.
guid	0	smth	A small number of non-UWP desktop apps do this but rely on service components to trigger restarting the app which is undesirable in a modern/UWP environment.
guid	0	smth	I'm aware that there's some potential overlap here with proposed timeline and sets functionality which allows people to continue where they left off but this request is specifically focused on what happens when the PC restarts without interaction when the user is away from the device.
guid	0	smth	This violates developer expectations.

guid	0	smth	The last three days I was working hard to solve a problem submitting our UWP app to the store.
guid	0	smth	Now I know why it was not working and I want to make my knowledge public.
guid	0	smth	We have an UWP app targeting Windows 10 fall creators update which was published successfully to the sore previously.
guid	0	smth	 A new version fails the certification process with â10.4.2 App Crash or Freezeâ
guid	0	smth	Side loadable release builds are also starting and working on our build and test machines
guid	0	smth	(This package contains our code compiled with the native tool chain)
guid	0	smth	But the â.appxbundleâ â package extracted from the *.appxupload (this is the zip-file uploaded to the store) fails at startup after it was side loaded on my test machine.
guid	0	smth	(for side loading you need to install the *.cer file contained in the AppPackages/AppName*version*_Test folder to your system cert store unter trusted roots) OK. Something must be wrong with the uploaded â.appxupload â package.
guid	0	smth	This package does always crash after side loading it.
guid	0	smth	So this crash is not the problem reported by the certification process!
guid	0	smth	Now things are very complicated:
guid	0	smth	- The uploaded â.appxuploadâ package contains the .NET dlls which are compiled via the native tool chain on the Microsoft certification server which generates a package which fails at startup.
guid	0	smth	Unfortunately there are no more details available from the certification process.
guid	0	smth	Also Microsoft support could not help me.
guid	0	smth	They build a package which fails without details and I can not download the build package for debugging.
guid	0	smth	Fortunately it does not try to start the build as part of the certification process.
guid	0	smth	So I was able to install the test flight package on my local machine for debugging.
guid	0	smth	Using some gflags and VS I was able to find that the entry point for âFormatMessageâ was not found.
guid	0	smth	The problem here was that for some VS releases the âC:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\10\App Certification Kit\SupportedAPIs-x?
guid	0	smth	?.xmlâ file contains some entry point definitions for FormatMessage which does not exist.
guid	0	smth	So the native tool chain compiles against the wrong entry point which causes the app crash at startup.
guid	0	smth	But why was it working on my local machine?
guid	0	smth	This is because I am using Visual Studio 15.7.1 which has already fixed the problem.
guid	0	smth	Unfortunately the build infrastructure of Microsoft which is used for the UWP certification process (at least for our targeted OS version: Windows 10 falls creators update) uses the buggy version of the SupportedAPIs-x?
guid	0	smth	After I used the latest version of PInvoke.Kernel32.dll which contains a workaround for the problem all was fine.
guid	0	smth	Local release builds created with the native toolchain of VS 15.7.1 are working.
guid	0	smth	Here the SupportedAPIs-x?
guid	0	smth	?.xml for their build environment!
guid	0	smth	I hope this helps!
guid	0	smth	Maybe it will help someone.

guid	0	smth	Side loadable release builds are also starting and working on our build and testâ¦ more

guid	0	smth	Previously this is messy because it requires setting from C# code to measure height of font and multiply by number of lines to set textbox height from code.
guid	0	smth	My approach is 100% XAML and doesn't require messy calculations.
guid	0	smth	When HeightLine != -1 then the height is calculated using HeightLine Property.

guid	0	smth	WinRT is littered with Async getters that greatly impede porting code and add unnecessary complexity for many cases.
guid	0	smth	When I've already created a dedicated thread anyway off the main UI for processing I don't need nor want WinRT API's spawn even more threads.
guid	0	smth	Although the intentions of increased threading throughput are respectable focus on writing API's that are foremost developer friendly.

guid	0	smth	what I think cool is getting the LatLong points of visible map layer allowing me to place any useful information on the sides or corner.
guid	0	smth	Trackpad activities are not unified across different controls.
guid	0	smth	However we can't do the same thing in map control or in photos app.
guid	0	smth	It acts just like using a mousewheel with increment and it makes us feel awful.
guid	0	smth	broadFileSystemAccess works when min version = 15036.

guid	0	smth	PickSingleFileAsync and PickSaveFileAsync functions do not work on IOT they just return nothing.
guid	0	smth	Also phone has support but is painful to use why is it different to the PC version?
guid	0	smth	Notepad has been updated to support Line endings from Unix Linux and Mac.
guid	0	smth	Its usage would be similar to SelectedForeground and SelectedBorderBrush:
guid	0	smth	SelectedBackground property - Gets or sets a brush that provides the background of a calendar item that's selected.
guid	0	smth	I experienced problem with UWP ListView particularly using ISupportIncrementalLoading interface as a datasource.
guid	0	smth	A few words about problem context:
guid	0	smth	In our UWP app there is a ListView and it uses ISupportIncrementalLoading as a DataSource.
guid	0	smth	And while next part of data is loading ListView is disabled.
guid	0	smth	So the problem in that if you scroll ListView in way you catch ScrollBar and pull it to the down
guid	0	smth	when you scroll to the end of the list ListView will be disabled for some period of time (while data is loading).
guid	0	smth	And if you release mouse button from ScrollBar
guid	0	smth	You cannot hover mouse on ScrollBar because when try to do it ScrollBar goes upper.
guid	0	smth	Note 1: I've got success with experiencing this problem in UWP app created from scratch (used ListView and ISupportIncrementalLoading).
guid	0	smth	Note 2: if discard of using ISupportIncrementalLoading
guid	0	smth	the problem exists but a bit another kind of.
guid	0	smth	Thanks in advance!
guid	0	smth	Unable to prevent auto close of InputPane which is creating issue due to a possible bug of InputPane in UWP with target version 16299 on Tablet.
guid	0	smth	For opening InputPane for 2nd Input element you have to tap outside to lose focus then you will have to tap that input again which will focus input and will open InputPane as its focused now through tapping not by tab button of InputPane.
guid	0	smth	This issue has been many times on stack overflow but its still answered.
guid	0	smth	I was actually excited to see it was built into the Nav control because i can't figure out where to place the backbutton either such that it doesn;t look weird and out of place... but the built-in nav backbutton doesn't solve the problem either... it still look weird and extreme beta...
guid	0	smth	Currently there's a set of COM APIs that provide access to Virtual Desktop-related features like pinning apps to desktops switching desktops etc.
guid	0	smth	Unfortunately most of it is undocumented and does not seem to be stabilized (2018 Spring Update for instance changed IApplicationView's CLSID so apps using it stopped working).

guid	0	smth	Thanks in advance for considering this.
guid	0	smth	The new WinRT MIDI APIs are broken and have been since their introduction with no sign of plans to be fixed.

guid	0	smth	I currently use Cortana each day on Windows 10 Android and iPhone.
guid	0	smth	I have noticed that sometimes the microphone function on the iPhone and Android app tends to stall or freeze.
guid	0	smth	It doesn't matter if I set the microphone to open upon application launch or activate the microphone; the delay in time the user has to wait to speak to Cortana is quite noticeable.
guid	0	smth	 I understand the limitations of Apple so it's unlikely the user will be able to respond to a text message directly on a Windows 10 PC.

guid	0	smth	What's the reason that currently Microsoft is blocking a price increase?
guid	0	smth	We tried to embrace Microsoft's vision for UWP but failed misreably wasting lots of time and money.
guid	0	smth	We built a UWP application that reads public data off ISO 7816 smart cards successfully until we realized that the app fails to function in release mode.
guid	0	smth	In debug mode it all works fine.
guid	0	smth	In release mode we generate the appx and it passes windows certification.
guid	0	smth	The smartcard functionality however which is based on a .net standard 2.0 library fails to work (https://github.com/danm-de/pcsc-sharp)
guid	0	smth	We are now trying to use the native UWP SmartCard API but its largely useless as we cannot find any methods to construct and transmit APDU which are the basic communication block
guid	0	smth	Hope this issue lands in the priority list of Microsoft.

guid	0	smth	This is so ridiculous that windows update doesn't have any rule and there is no way (believe me I googled a lot) to allow it securely (without allowing whole svhost.exe) even spotify has a default rule!
guid	0	smth	Both Process Isolation and Hyper-V Isolation for Containers are available in Windows Server 2016 but Windows 10 only supports Hyper-V isolation.
guid	0	smth	Hyper-V isolation has benefits but also has many drawbacks such as resource allocation performance as well as stability.
guid	0	smth	A simple check of the Docker for Windows issues board ( https://github.com/docker/for-win/issues ) shows a large imbalance of Windows 10 and Hyper-V isolation related issued where the Windows Server 2016 issues are much less common.
guid	0	smth	I have Docker build scripts that build 5 Docker images this script runs in 1 minute and 40 seconds on WIndows Server 2016 but takes 5 minutes and 30 seconds on Windows 10 and has rather frequent issues related to timeouts and hangs.

guid	0	smth	Hello I want to protect some user-mode code and read only data against other user-mode modification from a kernel-mode driver while allowing process handle creation.
guid	0	smth	But in my case i want to print receipt and don't want to show the receipt in the screen and just pass the bitmap image of receipt to POS Printer.
guid	0	smth	In UWP XAML binding something that is NOT an ICommand to an event gives an exception in the XAML compiler WCM9999: Object Reference not set to an instance of an object.
guid	0	smth	Using Microsoft gift cards as developer account registration fee.
guid	0	smth	well it's really powerful for indie devs
guid	0	smth	The app does not want to have too many stories on the screen and load stories on demand.
guid	0	smth	The first time the app is opened it downloads news article and display's say the top 10 to user in a ListView and rest are stored locally.
guid	0	smth	These are displayed if the user scrolls down (Incremental Loading Collection Helpers are great addition).
guid	0	smth	Now let's say next day the app is opened again.
guid	0	smth	As soon as new stories are downloaded they are added at the from of the ListView not all but say top 10 and rest goes to the disk/cache.
guid	0	smth	App immediately displays yesterday's news stories and works in background to load new stories (or user pulls to refresh).
guid	0	smth	Tablet Version: Microsoft Windows [version 10.0.16299.248]
guid	0	smth	Target version: Windows 10 (10.0; Build 10586)
guid	0	smth	Hello
guid	0	smth	This can cause a lot of unintended side effects.
guid	0	smth	It used to do this in Windows 8 and early Windows 10 versions but this apparently changed a while ago.
guid	0	smth	This will be a good addition.
guid	0	smth	Packaged COM (https://blogs.windows.com/buildingapps/2017/04/13/com-server-ole-document-support-desktop-bridge/#KgekWJeWFmOwUZRb.97) allows exposing out-of-proc COM objects using desktop bridge however these COM objects are not accessible from UWP apps even if the UWP apps are packaged into same desktop bridge exposes the COM objects.
guid	0	smth	It is understandable that when UWP app is run normally it can only access a limited set of COM objects; however if the UWP is packaged to desktop bridge it makes sense to allow it to access additional COM objects exposed by that desktop bridge using the technical described in the blog above.
guid	0	smth	We are a dev house that specialises in publishing dedicated Xbox Apps.
guid	0	smth	It used to be that there was a really high standard to get certified on Xbox which was tough to get through but at least the standard of apps was pretty high.
guid	0	smth	Now it seems there is zero standard to be certified to publish an app on Xbox and by default EVERY windows 10 app that is published is published on all devices.
guid	0	smth	It is totally crazy and really counterproductive to building any kind of a vibrant ecosystem.
guid	0	smth	One simple example is there is a PDF database app on the new apps list on XBOX!
guid	0	smth	You cannot use it it cannot access files and it has absolutely no viable function on Xbox One.
guid	0	smth	Yet somehow this passes certification and is thrown on the pile of rubbish that now clutters the new app section.
guid	0	smth	It is hugely frustrating to put months of work into building an app for xbox and stand no chance of getting it downloaded because nobody will ever be able to find it.
guid	0	smth	I know microsoft is trying to flesh out the app stores on each deviceâ¦ more
guid	0	smth	Currently desktop bridge supports in app purchases.
guid	0	smth	As of now there is no good ad network for existing desktop applications.
guid	0	smth	This feature is almost available in any web based video player or any Desktop based video player the feature is simple.
guid	0	smth	When a mediaplayerelement is playing or paused a video.
guid	0	smth	I'm aware of the sandboxing.
guid	0	smth	On UWP for x86-64 ARM and ARM64 it's not possible to comply with the Windows ABI when generating code at runtime because you cannot generate the mandatory exception table data for the dynamically-generated code.
guid	0	smth	Otherwise this function is useful to runtime code generation.
guid	0	smth	So I uninstalled KB4057144 became build 15063.850.
guid	0	smth	I think that it is the problem of baseimage and KB4057144.
guid	0	smth	Currently Microsoft Store under Windows 10 shows three types of information:
guid	0	smth	But there's no numerical value representing the amount of data that will have to be downloaded.
guid	0	smth	Please fix this annoying issue.
guid	0	smth	UWP is too safe so as to be impractical for so many desktop apps and WPF is like a third-class citizen with Microsoft in the background cheering Upgrade to UWP!
guid	0	smth	The sandbox nonsense has to go.
guid	0	smth	99% of the applications they install aren't (and won't be!)
guid	0	smth	sandboxed UWP applications anyway.
guid	0	smth	But it is not available by default.
guid	0	smth	CalcBinding makes binding expressions shorter and more user-friendly.
guid	0	smth	This is only available for WPF - https://github.com/Alex141/CalcBinding
guid	0	smth	Here are some examples
guid	0	smth	Right now it's possible to define apps for websites using app URI handlers.
guid	0	smth	These excludePaths feature supports only path matching right now not wildcards for the whole Uri.
guid	0	smth	UWP combobox is not showing the selected value under certain resolutions.
guid	0	smth	In visual studio if I select the container (a grid) and change something like the flow from horizontal to vertical the redraw fixes the issue which leads me to believe that it's the render.
guid	0	smth	We use the Create Date on log files to check if they can be deleted.
guid	0	smth	The problem is that when we delete that file and recreate it (same filename) the create date stays the same!
guid	0	smth	Run the code again.
guid	0	smth	The test.log file is created again.
guid	0	smth	Run this as many times as you like the create date will not change from the first time you ran the code.
guid	0	smth	How to reproduce.
guid	0	smth	It deletes the file.
guid	0	smth	Having SOCK_SEQPACKET would remove the burden of distinguishing between independent messages from the user.
guid	0	smth	Some users certainly will find this useful.
guid	0	smth	Sadly if you're someone who finds this annoying there's no option to disable this behavior.
guid	0	smth	According to the singular post I was able to find on this new feature (https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/forum/insider_wintp-insider_desktop/programs-autostart-after-boot-in-windows-10/09dd8d3e-7b36-45d1-9181-6587dd5d53ab?page=2&auth=1) there is no way to disable this.
guid	0	smth	It currently only supports octet-stream.
guid	0	smth	Actually we can't because the same notification would be send too if the user is closing the application.
guid	0	smth	This issue was reported for Visual Studio Feedback Site but They have determined that this issue belongs to universal windows platform.
guid	0	smth	It's tooo painful.
guid	0	smth	Uservoice already have it.
guid	0	smth	This works as expected on phones but not on computers/tablets.
guid	0	smth	I'm using Fall Creators update not sure how it behaves in other versions.
guid	0	smth	In my case I'm writing an app where you learn how to spell and don't want to give the user any hints :-)
guid	0	smth	Create a new blank UWP application and add this XAML code:
guid	0	smth	When I run this I expect to get no suggestions in the software keyboard when writing anything in the text box.
guid	0	smth	We are developing components on Linux which has dedicated system call and memory requests.
guid	0	smth	This would signify communication and access on the file system.
guid	0	smth	I have some more feature recommendations regarding extensions in adaptivegridview if you will.
guid	0	smth	and which operator to use [AND/OR] in case of multiple property filter provided.)
guid	0	smth	and this grouping will obviously include the semantic zoom feature as well.
guid	0	smth	Incremental Loading: I know this is already in the community toolkit.
guid	0	smth	Sorting : sorting with 1 or more properties.
guid	0	smth	These are some of the most common scenarios which are required by developers and there are many ways to do it but this can get very complicated to align them with best practices.
guid	0	smth	this search bar auto filters the items on basis of the filterDescriptor provided ( filter descriptor can be defined by the developer tht which stringtimeint property to match with which condition i.e : Contains startswith endswith e.t.c.
guid	0	smth	We also use multiple-top-level windows that are already available.
guid	0	smth	I have a disk imaging (which I have already converted) application that writes bytes directly to disk (USB and SD cards).
guid	0	smth	The app gets rejected during submission to the store as some features are disabled as admin privileges are required.
guid	0	smth	So in a round about way you're actually raising the chances of users getting viruses by blocking these apps as they just get them from the web instead.
guid	0	smth	Current clipboard API can notify about a clipboard content change which is fine.
guid	0	smth	But getting or setting the content doesn't work if the app is in background or unfocused.
guid	0	smth	If this is a privacy constraint thenâ¦ more
guid	0	smth	Currently the input will be validated if the focus of the Textbox lost.
guid	0	smth	It is possible for us to get a D3DDevice from MediaStreamSource as indicated by admins here:
guid	0	smth	I can verify that this works.
guid	0	smth	But unfortunately it is not possible to create a MediaStreamSample from D3D Surface.
guid	0	smth	x:Bind is great and I love it.
guid	0	smth	1) This limit is not in the [EmailMessage](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/uwp/api/windows.applicationmodel.email.emailmessage) documentation.
guid	0	smth	2) This limit appears to be arbitrary and not on par with other platforms (iOS / Android / Mac OSX).
guid	0	smth	This limitation is a contribution to a diminished user experience (and developer experience) when compared to these other platforms.
guid	0	smth	This idea is so bad on so many levels.
guid	0	smth	As a Xamarin.Forms developer I had to drill down 4 frameworks to find this limitation.
guid	0	smth	Especially if that steam roller is riddled with security issues and complexity way beyond the experience and latitude of most fly swatter users.
guid	0	smth	In [this](https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/sqlserver/en-US/6187a2cc-2683-4b15-b1e6-d90f3703ad0b/uwp-c-emailmanager-message-body-getting-truncated?forum=wpdevelop&prof=required) following forum post the character limit for an email body generated via code from an app is noted.
guid	0	smth	ContentDialog is currently far too difficult to use for two reasons: locking and placement.
guid	0	smth	This means that ContentDialog.ShowAsync will wait until any currently-displayed ContentDialog is dismissed before showing the new dialog.
guid	0	smth	On the other hand if ShowAsync( ContentDialogPlacement.InPlace) is used then (a) it is not convenient because one must separately embed the dialog in XAML and (b) it doesn't always work because an exception occurs if ShowAsync(InPlace) is called on the dialog before the XAML is fully loaded.
guid	0	smth	PasswordVault.FindAllByResource throws a COMException when there are no credentials for the resource (or maybe only when there are no credentials).
guid	0	smth	right now the window.closed event for desktop fires both for minimization and for closing events.
guid	0	smth	We are able to download previous versions of the release versions of the Windows SDK.
guid	0	smth	On the slow ring we are currently on Windows build 17025 but the only SDK download link provided on the Windows Insider download page is for 17061 at time of writing.
guid	0	smth	I am not willing to go to fast ring because this renders my laptop useless.
guid	0	smth	When you invoke the primary or secondary buttons in a ContentDialog you are not losing focus in the control that was last being edited.
guid	0	smth	I've tried forcing the control (in this case a TextBox) to lose focus programmatically in the Primary buttonevent handler but this does not help.
guid	0	smth	Ive also tried Bindings.Update - bit this does not help either.
guid	0	smth	If you are using x:Bind to bind that control's value to a property in the ContentDialog code-behind page then when you press the primary button the property doesn't get updated.
guid	0	smth	The expected behaviour is that when you click on the Primaryâ¦ more
guid	0	smth	I can't register dev account because of living in Republic of Moldova.
guid	0	smth	Currently there does not appear to be a way to set a window's startup position (left top width/right height/bottom) beyond full-screen and/or maximized.
guid	0	smth	Also the last used position for a given window isn't saved intrinsically.
guid	0	smth	Windows launch at random places on the desktop.
guid	0	smth	I understand this need does not really exist for mobile.
guid	0	smth	But for many desktop applications specifically container applications managing windows is a core feature objective.
guid	0	smth	it is similar like this issue : http://www.dcfever.com/cameras/specification.php?id=1620
guid	0	smth	We've inherit a control from Slider and put it in horizontal.
guid	0	smth	Our App would crash.

guid	0	smth	Editor is the value of x:Name given to RichEditBox element.
guid	0	smth	RotatorTile's behavior is like an automated FlipView.
guid	0	smth	Microsoft has added in the Camera App the Panorama Mode which works in some devices and tablets.
guid	0	smth	Don't know if it is a specific number of devices that currently this feature works.
guid	0	smth	Don't want a solution with the scrollviewer and the compass because I have already done that.
guid	0	smth	Convert EXE to APPX by command lines?
guid	0	smth	It's 21 century.
guid	0	smth	But the UWP textboxes are not that god when it comes to numeric input.
guid	0	smth	I'm currently working on a software that has a lot of numeric input.
guid	0	smth	Only allows numeric input
guid	0	smth	If the user enters a value less than the min value the value will be updated to min value on lost focus.
guid	0	smth	Format numbers with commas on thousands (i.e.

guid	0	smth	Even rendering on separate thread will block UI thread (for example Reveal highlight effect while bigger page is loading or typing into TextBox will lag while javascript in the page is running)

guid	0	smth	For instance when running my app on the Hololens it applies a 150% scale factor.

guid	0	smth	There's no sane way to do it e.g.

guid	0	smth	Thanks for considering changing this.
guid	0	smth	Say you throw up a message box a la Do you want to save the changes Yes/No/Cancel if you were to click Cancel there's no way to prevent the NavigationView to follow through with it visually.
guid	0	smth	In my opinion UWP is too much APP centric.

guid	0	smth	Repeatedly calling MediaPlayer.StepForwardOneFrame() `MediaPlayer.StepBackOneFrame() should switch between two frames but video is moving slightly back.
guid	0	smth	However if you make the parent visible binding will not be triggered and you must manually force an update to get bound values to appear.

guid	0	smth	It can be used between UWP apps but not in Windows Explorer which really is a shame.
guid	0	smth	There are desktop Win32 APIs for delay creation of files that are used heavily e.g.
guid	0	smth	in WinZIP and similar applications to delay actual unzip of files until really required but they cannot be used in UWP.
guid	0	smth	Things like MinConnectionInterval MaxConnectionInterval SlaveLatency and Connection Supervisory Timeout
guid	0	smth	It is a compendium of various PDF viewer tutorials rolled into a single user control.
guid	0	smth	This of course can already be found in WPF any for any developers who want to migrate their classic desktop app to UWP this would be a big boost.
guid	0	smth	So at the moment i have to tell my customers: open the folder-picker and navigate from the pictures-library to the path:D:\very long path..\final_folder.
guid	0	smth	actual implementing an selection of file or folder in UWP (how easy but stupid)
guid	0	smth	so picker.SuggestedStartLocation is not a string to a path but only a selection of libraries.
guid	0	smth	now after the great Windows 10 Fall Creators Update it is still a joke to switch and develop to UWP.
guid	0	smth	does anybody at MS have an idea how to propose an path in an UWP application?
guid	0	smth	Under UWP it is still not possible to open a folder or file out of the sandbox.

guid	0	smth	We'll currently I have a Uwp app that needs to call a web.api service that is secured with azure ad.
guid	0	smth	I have been looking for samples and tutorials to do this and I have found some.
guid	0	smth	But they all differ in what to do exactly.
guid	0	smth	For example a long running task where the user is not allowed to back out until it completes.
guid	0	smth	I need a similar feature for UWP.
guid	0	smth	There are several issues with the file activation NeighboringFilesQuery argument and the file system indexer.
guid	0	smth	If files are loaded using the NeighboringFilesQuery then GetPropertiesAsync on those files will only return properties that have been indexed.
guid	0	smth	This prevents reading things like altitude from the GPS location data.
guid	0	smth	The above is made a lot worse on computers where indexing file content is disabled (right click on the drive in Explorer select properties and see check box at the bottom) which used to be recommended for SSD drives.
guid	0	smth	In particular no ImageProperties are available in this case.
guid	0	smth	If the indexer is really broken (for some reason this started happening on my PC so is not uncommon) then it will fail to pick up any neighboring files at all (confirmed by using the default Photos app to open a photo in a folder with lots of photos and it only showed one photo).
guid	0	smth	I don't think this is a security issue because the data is in the file and the file contents are readable.
guid	0	smth	It looks like the tooltip is not perfectly aligned to the device pixels but rather half a pixel off vertically.
guid	0	smth	This is on Windows 10 Fall Creators Update (build 16299.19) @ 150% DPI scale the app targets Windows 10 SDK 16299.

guid	0	smth	Currently In MasterView we can only use ListView.

guid	0	smth	Then devs can use Connected Animations.
guid	0	smth	I upgraded to the latest VS 2017 and change my UWP app to use .Net.Native 2.0.
guid	0	smth	I don't call this function.
guid	0	smth	When I traced down some new crashes I found that Socket.ConnectAsync is trying to call this function and failing because it doesn't exist.
guid	0	smth	I have about 15-20 similar errors in the build that are referencing things I don't directly call.
guid	0	smth	I've reverted to .Net.Native 1.7 until this gets fixed.
guid	0	smth	Calling this method would throw exception at runtime.
guid	0	smth	In Windows Forms toolkit there is a handy control called the NumericUpDownControl.

guid	0	smth	We are experiencing an issue where the presence of a PasswordBox with a NumericPin InputScope overrides the InputScope of other controls on the page--until the PasswordBox has received focus.
guid	0	smth	On a touch screen this manifests every time a user reaches the first page in our UWP App that has a NumericPin-scoped PasswordBox.
guid	0	smth	3) Build and run the app
guid	0	smth	Keyboard remains NumericPin.
guid	0	smth	10) See that the InputScopes of the TextBoxes are now honored.
guid	0	smth	4) Before doing anything else click the Show touch keyboard button in the notification tray such that the touch keyboard appears.
guid	0	smth	I think I found a problem in Media Player.
guid	0	smth	In this case will be fired only MediaPlayer.PlaybackSession.PlaybackStateChanged event and it is not possible to detect whether app was paused through user or system.
guid	0	smth	But if phone calls then will be simulated SystemMediaTransportControls pause button click (MediaPlayer.SystemMediaTransportControls.ButtonPressed event) and on phone call I can correctly stop my player and change some states.
guid	0	smth	I've looked into using a SoftwareBitmapSource instead but this is a lot slower and uses more memory and I'm not 100% sure whether its Dispose method works (doesn't affect memory shown in VS debugger but did seem to have an effect when testing using a mobile emulator).
guid	0	smth	I am preloading images for speed and I need to release the memory immediately when no longer needed to prevent memory failures but setting the reference to null and even calling GC.Collect() immediately does not always result in an immediate release of memory.
guid	0	smth	Compact overlay window is always shown at the right-top corner.
guid	0	smth	This would help in hit testing of Visuals.
guid	0	smth	More details can be found in this issue
guid	0	smth	We can see the support of communities in UWPCommunityToolkit.
guid	0	smth	As a self-learner it is very hard to find a tutorial to learn new things.
guid	0	smth	I hear a lot about âclean uninstallâ but we noticed a few months ago appx leaves some stuff behind.
guid	0	smth	Specifically persisted appframe window sizing data remains behind potentially leaving the user/dev in a potential bad or confusing window state.
guid	0	smth	See the data piling up in the following stores:
guid	0	smth	A lot of small time developers like myself don't have the means to use the Microsoft Store to host their apps.

guid	0	smth	and not calling SetDesiredBounds!
guid	0	smth	This is what the screen looks like: https://1drv.ms/i/s!AqT0PAFUIw04htwcFjitFI7iNTXl5A
guid	0	smth	(sorry for the photo could not do a regular screen shot at the moment!)
guid	0	smth	Yes video and transport controls cover the entire media player!
guid	0	smth	Otherwise this looks cut and incomplete.
guid	0	smth	The safe area is removed... and it looks like the following: https://1drv.ms/i/s!AqT0PAFUIw04htwdhtSgx38PFkcWeQ
guid	0	smth	Page has no more safe area BUT on the transport controls have suddenly the safe area even though the media player is part WITHIN the page.
guid	0	smth	(For full screen it remains the same framed version as before so no additional screen shot) Why are transport controls no longer covering the entire video?
guid	0	smth	That's an real issue.
guid	0	smth	I am removing the safe area by calling SetDesiredBounds and I am experiencing framed transport controls then even when using as control somewhere within the page.
guid	0	smth	I debugged this a lot and found a solution (and realized a very dirty hack by Microsoft):
guid	0	smth	In my app I am using custom transport controls and I used the original template as a starting point.
guid	0	smth	This is documented nowhere and has the bad effect described above.
guid	0	smth	Nevertheless I would expect a less hacky solution.
guid	0	smth	And fiddling arround with a grid by name is just a dirty hack since this does not work with custom transport controls as long as the magic grid with it's name is not present.
guid	0	smth	But when we play a video file using MediaStreamSource it is not possible to pass through the subtitle streams because we cannot create MediaStreamDescriptors for them.
guid	0	smth	So audio and video works but subtitles don't work.
guid	0	smth	I am unable to use containers and VmWare/VirtualBox on Windows 10 at the same time due to the restriction of Hyper-V.
guid	0	smth	This restriction does not exist on Linux and MacOS.
guid	0	smth	It doesn't seem to quite have an equivalent in UWP in order to get even spacing of a grid automatically as well as other features like setting rows/columns and first column for calendar type applications.
guid	0	smth	A previous uservoice API to control screen brightness https://wpdev.uservoice.com/forums/110705-universal-windows-platform/suggestions/2359006-api-to-control-screen-brightness was marked closed after Creators update with Brightness control being introduced.
guid	0	smth	BrightnessOverride would fit the purpose except it requires IoT / Embedded mode and therefore cannot use this API.
guid	0	smth	Apple announced support for Fragmented MP4 backed HLS Streams under HLS version 7: https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2016/504/ at WWDC 2016.
guid	0	smth	We are looking to change the way our HLS streams are generated and Windows seems to be one of the few platforms that doesn't support playing these type of streams.
guid	0	smth	if the <DataTemplate x:DataType=models:LocalStatus> references POCO class that is in a seperate project the XAML will not compile.
guid	0	smth	I submitted this to the VS forum but they said to post the issue here.
guid	0	smth	We now have this option for ListView and GridView but not for the ComboBox control.
guid	0	smth	The StreamSocket class has no good way of polling the connection status without sending data (your connection may have died minutes ago but you won't know until you try to send something which isn't desirable).
guid	0	smth	The proposal is to add something like:
guid	0	smth	 // Something happened update your UI or run your business logic
guid	0	smth	While downloading a file with BackgroundDownloader the progress updates every 1MB which is not really accurate.
guid	0	smth	I've noticed that pausing and resuming the download accelerates the update rate to about every 250 ms.
guid	0	smth	There are many cases where you have different kind of data and group them by data type.
guid	0	smth	Or you display search results for various item types in one view.
guid	0	smth	But it causes a context switch from native->.net and back for each item which will slow down the control when showing a lot of items (this is noticeable on slow devices or phones).
guid	0	smth	Now the control does not need to call selector for every item speeding up the control.
guid	0	smth	But it causes a context switch from native->.net and back for each item whichâ¦ more
guid	0	smth	Desktop Bridge attracts me as a developer but Windows Store puts me off.

guid	0	smth	Otherwise the private store can only be used for in-house apps or free apps.
guid	0	smth	This crash occurs in all JavaScript apps that use the MediaCapture API to display camera Video previews.
guid	0	smth	According to the documentation it is possible to x:Bind events to a handler.
guid	0	smth	So for the CalendarView.SelectedDatesChanged event the following signature works:
guid	0	smth	This behavior is not found in public documentation.
guid	0	smth	When working with parameters this works as long as the parameters have the default names.
guid	0	smth	As per https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/projects/events/build/2017/dev-center-analytics-for-win32-developers?playlist=Dev-Center-Store-Services the Dev center has support to monitor Crash reports for native win32 desktop apps without publishing into the store.
guid	0	smth	But I couldn't find any option in my dev center account to support this functionality.
guid	0	smth	However the API was designed that it will introduce severe overhead in the following scenario.
guid	0	smth	These objects are semi-transparent (alpha-blending) so I need to draw them sorted by distance to camera (back to front) and not by state changes.
guid	0	smth	Let's assume I have 50 objects which are Soft Particles (SP)
guid	0	smth	Both SP and TM use alpha blending.
guid	0	smth	So both SP and TM do legal operations (they don't write to the depth buffer and read in the shader at the same time)
guid	0	smth	However in the worst case when SP and TM are ordered in the following way:
guid	0	smth	To my understanding OMSetRenderTargets is a slow operation but I need to call it 100 times.
guid	0	smth	-I don't need to call OMSetRenderTargets for each draw call where I want to change D3D11_DSV_READ_ONLY_DEPTH.
guid	0	smth	Say I have 100 objects to draw.
guid	0	smth	SP don't do depth writes but they do depth-testsâ¦ more
guid	0	smth	it's extremely annoying when I face service issues with devcenter with no knowledge if they are investigated or not.
guid	0	smth	I don't want all the time contact support wait wait wait and yeah we have issues or now is just Saturday...I've to wait til Monday?
guid	0	smth	With service issue I mean devcenter backend is down or doesn't work properly in some ways.

guid	0	smth	The WebView control doesn't allow printing embedded PDFs etc.
guid	0	smth	If it works in Edge Chrome and Firefox it should work in WebView control.
guid	0	smth	Since Edge doesn't support lockdown usage (like IE did with Kiosk mode) it makes it even more important to have this.
guid	0	smth	I add a CustomAudioEffect which is EQ (I've also tried using official UWP sample's EchoEffect) to MediaPlayer.
guid	0	smth	Although it seems CustomAudioEffect is running on Worker thread not UI thread it seems media playback would also be impact when UI loading a bit heavier.
guid	0	smth	I could hear my music become intermittently.
guid	0	smth	So often the png splash screen is larger than all of the app's compiled code.

guid	0	smth	The current support for Bluetooth LE in Win10 Creators Update does not allow publishing of an Eddystone beacon ( https://developers.google.com/beacons/eddystone ) because the api reserves the use of many data section types.

guid	0	smth	Before recent changes we were (ab)using the .Reset event type to inform the UI components that the collection has changed.

guid	0	smth	For large teams just having one team member being able to do this is a bad design decision.

guid	0	smth	My current Backgroundtask has a timer in it which would allow my background task to wake up on a timer event periodically do some processing then wait again.

guid	0	smth	I handle rendering the entire interface with my own commands using DirectX rendering.
guid	0	smth	This works briliantly with just few lines of code.
guid	0	smth	Which means there's no real simple API for UWP to do this and what I want is a simple API.
guid	0	smth	So many things to do compared to just drag and drop.
guid	0	smth	Also I've followed your links and it really sounds awfully complicated honestly I don't know where to start.
guid	0	smth	For example: I drag and drop C:\Folder\image.bmp file onto my app window and my app will generate C:\Folder\image.png So what I need is a simple API like: void OnFilesDropped(String file_names[] int window_client_pos_x int window_client_pos_y) {..} where 'file_names' is an array of full path names of all files/folders drag and dropped onto the app and other 2 parameters are the XY coordinates of the client window position where the drag and drop occured.

guid	0	smth	Why are you limiting UWP and DirectX12 to flip mode that is slower?
guid	0	smth	While BC7 is great the BC1 quality is not really good however we still need small size for textures as my game is currently over 11 GB of texture data.
guid	0	smth	What happened to ASTC texture format?
guid	0	smth	Originally this was supposed to be included in DirectX but later was scrapped.

guid	0	smth	I've read about Project Rome and the possibility of creating cross-device experiences (https://blogs.windows.com/buildingapps/2016/10/11/cross-device-experience-with-project-rome/) and am particularly interested in the Project Rome Android SDK (https://blogs.windows.com/buildingapps/2017/02/08/announcing-project-rome-android-sdk/#HQl7ibqTUGYzrufw.97).
guid	0	smth	a) It is extremely slow.
guid	0	smth	b) It draws MapPolygons blurred with jagged borders.
guid	0	smth	c) It draws MapPolylines in wrong positions (very very often).
guid	0	smth	They take right position then after manual shifting of map but initially 20-30% of them are misplaced after being added to MapElements collection.
guid	0	smth	Most often it occurs near map borders.
guid	0	smth	The SDK itself support the side-by-side installation then we can try the new API with our UWP Apps.
guid	0	smth	But there are no way to distribute this kind of app to testers or customers that use Win10 Insider preview.
guid	0	smth	It only allow the Customer Update SDK level.
guid	0	smth	You know many of Microsoft Apps are updated with new SDK and it'll be available at the store during Insider Preview.
guid	0	smth	For example MS provide the lot of sdk and new technologies about Win10 Fall CU.
guid	0	smth	This is really a must for apps that target businesses or wish/must to support older devices that will not get the latest versions.

guid	0	smth	It appears that the MapIcon rendering by the MapControl has changed significantly with the Windows 10 Creators update.
guid	0	smth	We have an app that at times adds hundreds of MapIcon objects to the MapControl.
guid	0	smth	Before Creators update this worked fine and the vast majority if not all were displayed.
guid	0	smth	After creators update we are only seeing a small portion of the MapIcon objects being rendered onto the map.
guid	0	smth	And it's not because they are colliding with other MapIcons.
guid	0	smth	We are seeing large portions of the map not displaying any of the MapIcons we've added.
guid	0	smth	We have always been aware of the guidance that a MapIcon is not guaranteed to be displayed but it's never been a problem.
guid	0	smth	We've even tried setting MapElementCollisionBehavior.RemainVisible but it doesn't make much difference.
guid	0	smth	It seems like there's now some sort of internal limit on how many MapIcons are displayed at a time.
guid	0	smth	I couldn't find anything in the release notes about this change.
guid	0	smth	Is this change in behavior expected or a bug?

guid	0	smth	It is available on the PC though.
guid	0	smth	As a result skeletal tracking apps do not work on the XBOX platform.
guid	0	smth	The UWP application platform has a rich media API which allows querying of a video device (e.g.
guid	0	smth	the Kinect) and seeing if it supports things like ExposureControl.
guid	0	smth	I've noticed that when you create a DataPackage containing both data provided directly (let's say text using SetData) and delayed formats like a bitmap (using SetDataProvider) when closing the application the whole clipboard content is cleared.
guid	0	smth	In VS2015 (and maybe in 2017) the compiler raised a warning (that we missed) that stated some of our code was currently unsupported by the UWP toolchain.

guid	0	smth	It could save us (developers) a lot of time.
guid	0	smth	There is only one direction for the radial progress bar control (clockwise).
guid	0	smth	But the xbox one doesn't provide any diagnostics data of apps (e.g.

guid	0	smth	There is a section for that in the device portal but there is currently not data.
guid	0	smth	Users are asking me frequently for a XBox version of my app.
guid	0	smth	It's just the same like with mobile.
guid	0	smth	Here we have several emulators and I usually make use of them first instead of plugging a device immediately.
guid	0	smth	Even more important XBox has a limited API with respect to desktop and mobile.
guid	0	smth	(NetworkInformation object not available etc.)
guid	0	smth	Personally I won't enable XBox without having tested my app first - at least in an emulator.
guid	0	smth	Unfortunately I do not own a XBox nor would getting one make sense (it is a free app so I am not really interested in spending lots of money just for developing purpose.)

guid	0	smth	The SuggestedStartLocation is not always used as the start location for the file picker.
guid	0	smth	In this situation SuggestedStartLocation makes it more confusing because when the user tries to pick a music file the FileOpenPicker is opening in the PicturesLibrary.

guid	0	smth	I use an event to change opacity to 1 once the image is loaded and sized and immediately I noticed that instead of just displaying the image faded in with a 1-second animation.
guid	0	smth	This animation seems hard-coded into the style so to get rid of it I would have to redefine the style.
guid	0	smth	A real pain just to get rid of the animation.
guid	0	smth	One of the problems I encounter is my inability to get Jack Info as in IKsJackDescription::GetJackDescription()

guid	0	smth	Please support the passing of all selected files as command arguments.
guid	0	smth	All the documentation on how to call UWP methods are in C# and require the .NET platform.

guid	0	smth	Master Panel in MasterDetailsView was intended to be used as PullToRefreshListView because usually the ListView in Master Panel is dynamically changing It is often used for showing Collections of Emails Articles etc.
guid	0	smth	How UWP apps can compete with other systems with such things?
guid	0	smth	Not mentioning that some kind of apps need more than 1000 file access - why to give such a handicap for the whole platform?

guid	0	smth	The Windows Store analytics API is great.
guid	0	smth	The most important data is the Conversions breakdown by campaign ID table at the bottom of the page.

guid	0	smth	This is really important not only for menus & toolbar buttons.

guid	0	smth	At the moment there is no easy way to prevent a one-way binding from clearing when a DependencyProperty is set to a new value.
guid	0	smth	Our desktop application displays a dialog using the GetOpenFileName API function access to the Network Drive may fail.

guid	0	smth	We can't use that at all.
guid	0	smth	This enumeration is mainly used with AppBarButton like as <AppBarButton Icon=Smile/>.
guid	0	smth	Recent Segoe MDL2 asset have many of new glyphs.
guid	0	smth	But the enumeration of Symbol is not updated from Win10 10240.
guid	0	smth	And some of important glyphs of 10240 are also lacked from the enumeration.
guid	0	smth	For example Share glyph - 0xE72D - is not enumerated.
guid	0	smth	But many of developers don't.
guid	0	smth	(Like Photo app)
guid	0	smth	This cause the many of engineers use the bitmap or other similar glyphs.
guid	0	smth	This is still happening - I've tested it myself now after the update to 10.0.14393.953.
guid	0	smth	My users are also reporting the same problem and some of them say they resign of the app/platform (!)
guid	0	smth	and I must say that I completely understand them.
guid	0	smth	How we the developers are supposed to work when such important thing like access to files is not working after the OS update.
guid	0	smth	This affects many of the apps and in result the whole platform.
guid	0	smth	The FutureAccessList has an issue.
guid	0	smth	After a firmware update for my phone I was unable to retrieve folders/files from a token.
guid	0	smth	The token I was asking for was present in the FutureAccessList but it gave me a FileNotFoundException.
guid	0	smth	As the pervious post has been marked as completed: https://wpdev.uservoice.com/forums/110705-universal-windows-platform/suggestions/13364760-futureaccesslist-token I'm rising the problem again.
guid	0	smth	Please let me know if you would like to use this as the code itself is ready to go and easy to use.
guid	0	smth	Today only SelectRange(ItemIndexRange itemIndexRange) exists in ListView to add new selection range to the current selection and SelectedRanges property is only { get; }.
guid	0	smth	Expected behavior:
guid	0	smth	I noticed there is a possibility to block payments in the interface of my Windows Store developer account but it is a Boolean.
guid	0	smth	Would it be possible to get paid only a certain amount leaving the remainder blocked on the MS account ?
guid	0	smth	And the interest for MS would be obvious.
guid	0	smth	We live in a connected world.
guid	0	smth	And I have a connected app that benefits from fast low latency networks but can work with a larger buffer if need be.
guid	0	smth	Textbox that indicates Validation Results (This Filed is Required...)
guid	0	smth	In an ideal world I should be able to invoke a task and than optionally send it somewhere else for continuation or just forget about it.
guid	0	smth	Right now the APIs only allow recognition of text input.
guid	0	smth	I know Microsoft already has the digital ink recognition technology for math formulas.
guid	0	smth	It's even available in WPF via Math Input Control.
guid	0	smth	It seems that since around 15043 when showing LoggingChannel.LogMessage() calls the string message portion is blank in device portal (shows stringmessage:).
guid	0	smth	Same code on machine with anniversary update portal shows the string message in payload.
guid	0	smth	capturing events with xperf shows the message in EventData as expected so I know it's logging correctly.

guid	0	smth	This method can be called multiple times for the same header.
guid	0	smth	The values will then be concatenated.
guid	0	smth	The problem comes when we want to create multiple downloads with one downloader if the server requires to send request via headers we are not able to downloaded files/items within one downloader every item requires to create a new downloader instance with new headers.

guid	0	smth	The very early work in progress version is available on my repo: https://github.com/japf/uwp-material-clock
guid	0	smth	In UWP we have a CommandBar but it seems it's not easy to use to build a classic toolbar for a desktop application.
guid	0	smth	But as this is such a central control it should be part of the platform.
guid	0	smth	Iâve spent some hours to build a small MVVM/UWP/Pivot Prototype that does the typical stuff we do today in WPF with TabControl.

guid	0	smth	I'm using the TreeView of your official samples on https://github.com/Microsoft/Windows-universal-samples/tree/dev/Samples/XamlTreeView.
guid	0	smth	The point that I really miss when working with hierarchical data is the HierarchicalDataTemplate like we have it today in WPF.
guid	0	smth	It makes especially sense when you release a control for hierarchical data like the TreeView.
guid	0	smth	1000 entries as limit for FutureAccessList is way to low.
guid	0	smth	Best practice until now:
guid	0	smth	Store the folder containing the file wont exceed the limit as fast as storing each file in the FutureAccessList.

guid	0	smth	A big downside hides in DragDrop (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/app-to-app/drag-and-drop)
guid	0	smth	To counter that and trying to add the folder from the file this won't be possible because an exception would be thrown even if you added the file itself to the FutureAccessList before that.
guid	0	smth	Example (trying to add folder from dragDrop Filetarget to FutureAccessList):
guid	0	smth	 // We're not able to add this folder
guid	0	smth	I don't for how long but I noticed it a few days back that there is a change in de Windows app store seacchresults.

guid	0	smth	Similar request but a report control for rdlc support:
guid	0	smth	Currently it is nearly impossible to create a custom virtualizing panel.
guid	0	smth	But in UWP it is impossible because the base classes have private constructors and the other classes are sealed.
guid	0	smth	A lot of custom controls do not use virtualization because it is so hard to implement in UWP.
guid	0	smth	This makes the controls hard or even impossible to use with large collections.

guid	0	smth	The current options have the current drawbacks for me:
guid	0	smth	There are genuine use cases when we need to keep an app running when close button is pressed.
guid	0	smth	You can only allow an app to catch close button event and minimise it to task bar programatically.

guid	0	smth	Currently an in-process appservice can be invoked without actually launching the main app ui.
guid	0	smth	This control is not to be confused with the existing pivot viewer in UWP.

guid	0	smth	The control is the equivalent of a pivot table in excel  you simply add the datasets with labels and the control sorts out all the selection fields  visualizations and animations.
guid	0	smth	This was the original microsoft link for the pivot control in Silverlight :
guid	0	smth	It might be necessary to ensure the downloaded base images are not corrupted and it would be very nice for you to provide them.
guid	0	smth	I cannot port my Windows Phone Silverlight App to UWP because it is depending on the Panorama Control which is missing in UWP.
guid	0	smth	The Hub control is not a suitable replacement.
guid	0	smth	Following data would be great:
guid	0	smth	Linked to GitHub https://github.com/Microsoft/UWPCommunityToolkit/issues/821
guid	0	smth	There is SystemTriggerType PowerStateChange but it is not triggered when percent is changed.
guid	0	smth	So one of two options would be useful:
guid	0	smth	Right now to show something on lock screen we have text and icon notifications at the bottom.
guid	0	smth	There is no way to implement complex text markup rendering without Direct2D or slow manual composition inside Canvas control.
guid	0	smth	There is absolutely no easy way to implement selectable text with complex markup.
guid	0	smth	RichEditBox control exists but there is no lightweight control for just display rich text (RichTextBlock isn't related to RichEditBox and feature-lame).
guid	0	smth	The ToastNotification object has a convenient ExpirationTime property that automatically dismisses it after a given period.
guid	0	smth	Unfortunately the ScheduledToastNotification which is just a ToastNotofcation but scheduled lacks this helping feature.
guid	0	smth	This makes me as a developer scracth my head and write a lot of code including background tasks just so I circumvent this problem and not have the users of my app get crowded with not-so-relevant-anymore notifications in their action center.
guid	0	smth	The MapControl is quite limited in operations with custom tiles.
guid	0	smth	I have need to redraw the tiles periodically because they become outdated (the closest similar example is traffic layer which needs to be periodically refreshed).
guid	0	smth	Even more since this operation results in tiles flickering (because of redraw) I have to use 3 tile sources switching between them.
guid	0	smth	That crasy staff involves heavy redrawing of the map and it also leads to visble scrolling slowing down in the moment of MapTileSource adding (which would be nice to fix too).
guid	0	smth	The (ugly) workaround I use is adding and removing MapTileSource which forces tiles redraw.
guid	0	smth	Currently UWP apps have no ability to include menu controls with excellent mouse support.
guid	0	smth	One click to close the first menu and a second click to open the new one.
guid	0	smth	At the moment there is no possibility to quickly navigate through long lists on small screens.
guid	0	smth	But sometimes lists are not in alphabetic order or there are still thousands of entries starting with the same letter.
guid	0	smth	I donât know what the component should look like.
guid	0	smth	If the list is alphabetic there is at least the possibility to jump to the first entry with the same first letter.
guid	0	smth	I want to test my apps in multiple languages without changing the region of my entire device.
guid	0	smth	(I already have a database file encrypted by SQL Cipher and I just have to read the records)
guid	0	smth	But SQLCipher is not - it supports only commercial edition ($899) and I can't afford the expense.
guid	0	smth	Surprisingly NO ONE OF THEM supports Universal App implementation.
guid	0	smth	That's ridiculous and I'm sick and tired of finding the way.
guid	0	smth	Does Microsoft really NOT support local database in developing Universal App?
guid	0	smth	I know SQLite support Universal App Development through Nuget in VS2015
guid	0	smth	That's ridiculous and I'm sick and tiredâ¦ more
guid	0	smth	Basic scenario is the need to store set of secret API keys for various 3-rd party APIs (twitter for example).
guid	0	smth	Just to hardcode API keys inside app executable files is security risk as it can be reverse engeneered.
guid	0	smth	Hello there is currently a bug withing the insider preview for desktop and phone.
guid	0	smth	Mouse scrolling works fine and it was also tested on the normal Windows builds where it was working as intended.
guid	0	smth	And I created this thread on the MSDN forum where it was confirmed that this is an insider preview bug: https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/windowsapps/en-US/af38910b-e097-484a-a76a-94fb7880da6b/uwpwinjslistview-items-cannot-be-invoked-after-scrolling-the-listview-with-the-touchscreen?forum=wpdevelop
guid	0	smth	You can also find a code sample here
guid	0	smth	I found this thread on Github: https://github.com/winjs/winjs/issues/1654
guid	0	smth	Could do something like:
guid	0	smth	 <td style='...'>My teste here</td>
guid	0	smth	This is reproducible in the XamlAnimatedGif sample app on Win 10 Desktop.
guid	0	smth	At least one of the animated GIFs will disappear.
guid	0	smth	Eventually they all disappeared for me.
guid	0	smth	This facility exist for public store apps but not LOB ones.
guid	0	smth	I find myself writing this control over and over in various projects and it's never vey good.
guid	0	smth	* Allow panning and zooming.
guid	0	smth	It also creates a large hurdle for new users and causes a number of headaches.
guid	0	smth	The issue is that our software uses ui access to emulate an onscreen touchpad and custom gestures.
guid	0	smth	We also allow for simultaneous pen and touch to add touch keyboard hotkeys to a docked custom keyboard (typically aids in drawing and ink based applications)
guid	0	smth	I love what you guys are doing and can not tell you enough how much anticipation I have to get in touch with you guys and find the answers to these questions.

guid	0	smth	Currently SmartCard API doesn't have any method to force a reader to reset smartcard (Cold Reset or Warm Reset as described in ISO7816-3).

guid	0	smth	This is really way too long in UWP Xaml not addressed.

guid	0	smth	I have two versions of my app: one for Windows Phone 8.1 (v1.x.x.x) and another one for Windows 10 Mobile (v2.x.x.x).
guid	0	smth	Latter uses new features of Windows 10 and receives excellent reviews but store mixes them with worse ratings from Windows Phone 8.1 users.
guid	0	smth	My app users are reporting that they can't get information about my durable add-on on the Xbox One and Xbox One S.
guid	0	smth	When my code checks for the property AddOnLicenses the collection is empty for users that have purchased the add-on.
guid	0	smth	We have tried with ExtendedJsonData property but the add-on array is empty too.
guid	0	smth	We can't determine if the add-on is active and neither the expiration date.

guid	0	smth	We have a uwp in the store and a desktop companion app.
guid	0	smth	Currently to install our software (and have it function) both programs are needed.
guid	0	smth	The issue we run into is that our desktop app uses ui access.
guid	0	smth	Is ui access support on the list of upcoming features?
guid	0	smth	I would be beyond excited to get a response.
guid	0	smth	It would mean the world to our small team to hear from you all!
guid	0	smth	Some of our ui access features may be convertible to direct ink functionality would that be a worthwhile pursuit or would that leave us facing the same intersection from a different direction?
guid	0	smth	our app is called tablet pro it may be of use to know that.
guid	0	smth	Building our email list has been at the forefront of our small software companies goals for a few years.
guid	0	smth	Probably the biggest question I have is how to use the store without loosing our ability to acquire user emails without complicating the process for the end user.
guid	0	smth	I may simply be unaware of how this is done.
guid	0	smth	This would be HUGE.
guid	0	smth	We like a number of the benefits the store offers but it seems without a way to build an list of our clients independent of Microsoft (or anyone but us for that matter) is KEY.
guid	0	smth	Is there a process in place for gaining downloaders email addresses?
guid	0	smth	Since 2009 the advent of Silverlight PivotViewer Control shifted the handling of large datasets giving a way of filtering and analyzing large volumes of data.
guid	0	smth	For line of business applications processing large datasets.
guid	0	smth	Currently the ScrollViewer's content can be overpanned.
guid	0	smth	Support the last version of Net Standard 1.6.
guid	0	smth	Developing desktop apps for UWP is subpar as many API are not present like SqlClient.
guid	0	smth	The store does not allow a developer to update their response to a user's review once it is made public while users are allowed to update their reviews at will.
guid	0	smth	I am attempting to design something to support functionality similar to Android's startActivityForResult() using the page stacks but I have no visibility into the management of the page stacks (BackStack and ForwardStack).
guid	0	smth	This introduces the opportunity for a memory leak as these stacks are pruned in response to user navigations.
guid	0	smth	WinRT information: The maximum number (1000) of items in the access list has been reached.
guid	0	smth	This supports the use case for providing a detail view for both the underlying item represented by the Group Header Template as well as that of the represented by the ItemTemplate.
guid	0	smth	Currently I am prohibited from extending and overridding various methods (in my case those concerning Navigation).
guid	0	smth	As a long time WP7/8 and now W10M user I noticed inconsistent behavior of opening flyout with touch versus mouse.
guid	0	smth	Instead in W10M it opens just when I release the finger.
guid	0	smth	This is very annoying as I never know if there is some additional menu under the item or not.
guid	0	smth	Context menu appears while my finger is still touching the screen.
guid	0	smth	But when using touch gesture I would expect behavior known from WP7/8 - flyout (aka context menu) should open after couple miliseconds while my finger is still touching the given item.
guid	0	smth	I use IMFSourceReader on UWP and noticed following bug with FLAC decoding: it will not change position if SetCurrentPosition will be called right after initialization.
guid	0	smth	It is working correct with .mp3 and other codecs but not with FLAC.
guid	0	smth	This would allow apps to say they were listening to KEXP instead only 93.1 and the station information as well.
guid	0	smth	With Silverlight in Windows Phone i had the ability to use FM radio APIs.
guid	0	smth	In UWP I cannot use these APIs as they weren't brought over.
guid	0	smth	from an accessory device (like a smartwatch) possible.
guid	0	smth	Our desktop application provides users with custom contact data that we'd like to sync for them with Windows 10 contacts.
guid	0	smth	We are working on the Converted version of the app to enable such capabilities and to distribute our desktop app via the Windows Store but we have to distribute it for previous versions of Windows as well and so we can't afford having two completely different versions of the product for the time being.
guid	0	smth	Why do you always have to make a developer's life difficult.
guid	0	smth	There's no easy way to detect Left Control key pushes.
guid	0	smth	Because on international keyboards if Right Alt is pressed then Left Control is also pressed?
guid	0	smth	Why oh why this is the stupidest thing ever.
guid	0	smth	But that doesn't work too because now it turns out that if I press just RightAlt then I can get callbacks for LeftCtrl and RightAlt happening in different frames.
guid	0	smth	OnKeyDown with LeftCtrl gets called in frame 10
guid	0	smth	OnKeyDown with RightAlt gets called in frame 11
guid	0	smth	Waiting for reply.
guid	0	smth	So I've developed a work around to detect key pushes for LeftCtrl and RightAlt and if both are pressed at the same time then LeftCtrl pushes are ignored.
guid	0	smth	I want my user to stay inside my app.
guid	0	smth	I'm using the result of MidiOutPort::GetDeviceSelector() for the device selector string.
guid	0	smth	The DeviceInformation for some of the virtual software ports on the system are returning with generic device names.
guid	0	smth	A user of yMidi contacted me about this problem.
guid	0	smth	Heâs using loopMidi a virtual MIDI loopback from Tobias Erichsen.

guid	0	smth	This gave the MasterDetailsView the time it needed to subscribe to the event first in order to handle it.

guid	0	smth	Hello All
guid	0	smth	This would mimic the Android capability that already exists for its Navigation drawer.
guid	0	smth	I have actually implemented this in one of my apps so you can see it in action.
guid	0	smth	It is in an app called Drudge Live (https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps/9wzdncrdm04m) and in the app the swipe-open capability is only enabled on phones.
guid	0	smth	Based on feedback I have received the capability is very important because it allows the use and opening of hamburger menus on phones using one hand.
guid	0	smth	I was previously getting a lot of grief over the switch to a hamburger menu by phone users but this gives them back the ability to navigate with one hand on the phone.
guid	0	smth	However there seems to be no such accommodation for style definitions located either in ResourceDictionary files or embedded directly into the page XAML.
guid	0	smth	In code there is a way to detect and work with features that are in newer Windows 10 builds (using ApiInformation) so that code can use new features while gracefully degrading on older builds.
guid	0	smth	If you have a style that uses a new property or enumeration value anyone opening the app in an older Win 10 build will immediately crash.
guid	0	smth	It's a lot easier to build a following when it's free.
guid	0	smth	Keeping this in mind was thinking of making some of my products donationware.
guid	0	smth	The ability for an end user to donate allows me to make the app free.
guid	0	smth	Support for developers willing to get the apps converted and placed in the Windows store is below anecdotal.
guid	0	smth	Like thousands of other developers I have tried for now over a month to convert my app and followed every literatureput up by Microsoft but am still stuck with dependencies.
guid	0	smth	Tried to post in UWP apps but questions remain unanswered.

guid	0	smth	The WNS currently does not seem to support loc-key loc-args APNS equivalents.
guid	0	smth	As a result all of the notification strings have to be generated server-side iterating for all the languages supported by the client (like https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/notification-hubs-ios-xplat-localized-apns-push-notification/) .
guid	0	smth	This causes us to treat the windows platform as a special case while APNS / GCM provide a single cohesive story.
guid	0	smth	This gets even more painful when we work with client-application teams that want to customize the localized strings for their platform for a loc-key loc-args contract.
guid	0	smth	This gets even more painful when we work with client-application teamsâ¦ more
guid	0	smth	Currently the xaml engine of UWP does not manage complex control attributes since it does not take System.ComponentModel.TypeConverter into account.
guid	0	smth	That is why we can not write this simple xaml user code:
guid	0	smth	where the complex property is Begin and the complex value is 12 that represents a position {X=1 ; Y=2}.
guid	0	smth	By the way that will be a lot simpler than the WPF's TypeConverter.
guid	0	smth	After having tried TypeConverter on UWP I tried to add implicit operators (casts) to the complex type (Position here) from and to string but xaml does not take them into account.

guid	0	smth	CoreIndependentInputSource has it's own Dispatcher does that mean it has it's own HWND/message queue?
guid	0	smth	Maybe that's the cause of the bug PointerVisualizationSettings.GetForCurrentView() is tied to the main Window.
guid	0	smth	I got the _hWnd from CoreIndependentInputSource.Dispacher using the VS debug inspector and then called TryDisableWindowsVisualFeedback() as seen here http://stackoverflow.com/questions/27550373/disable-touch-visual-feedback-on-windows-8-1-programmatically-desktop-app

guid	0	smth	In Windows Store the longer app's titles or capitalized app's titles for example COBATA (X)HTML Constructor are cut to 14-15 characters doing the app's title meaningless for example COBATA (X)HTML.

guid	0	smth	HTTP.sys serves as the kernel component backing IIS and the .NET HttpListener.
guid	0	smth	There are a number of failure cases such as a high incoming request rate filling the request queue that can result in the module rejecting incoming requests directly without handing them off to callers higher on the stack.
guid	0	smth	Information about these failed requests is currently only visible via the HTTPERR log file and a few Perf counters.
guid	0	smth	Neither is ideal.
guid	0	smth	The log file is system-wide requires admin access and lacks any information about what request queue the error is associated with.
guid	0	smth	As such it plays a critical role as the first system to process each incoming HTTP request but it is unfortunately lacking in diagnostics.

guid	0	smth	I'm confused what the **** is that?
guid	0	smth	Also the AudioGraph can't to be ensure generate 10ms of AudioFrame data even though I have set the QuantumSizeSelectionMode property to ClosestToDesired.

guid	0	smth	When initiating a chat session the page asks you to let the operator know what the issue is and provides a virtually limitless text field.
guid	0	smth	There is no indication that the text field will only transmit the first 38 characters to the support technician but that apparently is the limit.
guid	0	smth	This ends up further frustrating an already distressed developer and making the job that much harder for the support operator needlessly.
guid	0	smth	This leads the user to have to type AGAIN the whole description.
guid	0	smth	The name reservation field doesn't accept spaces.
guid	0	smth	loopMIDI is also an example of this in the MIDI realm allowing on-the-fly creation/destruction/renaming of virtual MIDI ports although lacking the routing/filtering layer which MIDI-OX's (primitive GUI) routing+filtering is a good example of.
guid	0	smth	Some of the above is already possible today (there's some Virtual-Audio-Cable solutions) but it's cumbersome non-standard and definetely not done (optimized?)
guid	0	smth	All the above is also somewhat possible today but there's no OS based unified paradigm easily controllable by the user.
guid	0	smth	There has been a huge spike in spammers scraping the Windows Store website for apps' support email.
guid	0	smth	The automated script leaves a 5 star review and asks that you do the same for their app.
guid	0	smth	I recenlty rated your app https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/p/hacked/9nblggh6850j with 5 stars and caption and text 'Great Tool' / 'I will admit that installing this app was an ordeal.
guid	0	smth	I want to thank Lancelot for taking the time to communicate quickly with me.
guid	1	smth	have an exporter for a Adobe XD file that could translate to XAML.
guid	1	smth	and it would be great to have a signed version DXGI_FORMAT_R10G10B10A2_SNORM
guid	1	smth	Add support to allow WCF services to be consumed that have custom username/password authentication on the binding.
guid	1	smth	I believe that everyone in XAML lovers we want a robust and complete standard and that facilitates the life of the developer so I propose to include these controls as a standard of XAML specification.
guid	1	smth	I would like from the device portal the ability to reset the device.
guid	1	smth	Create a control for Continue in different device Like Continue Reading etc.
guid	1	smth	So it would be nice to create controls to achieve Microsoft's vision easily.
guid	1	smth	I would like my apps be automatically supported on any new processor architectures.
guid	1	smth	Please add simple API:
guid	1	smth	The application XBOX DEV MODE COMPANION should have an option to make it a VR.
guid	1	smth	Make it something unique windows phone attracting more customers.
guid	1	smth	Have a separate Class Library that only supports new SDK versions and it will only be loaded into the app on newer SDK versions therefore you can write safe XAML markup including new Controls and Properties.
guid	1	smth	Alternatively it would be nice if the UWP platform was updated separately from Windows so apps would be able to support all the new Controls/Styles.
guid	1	smth	There needs to be a way to define new XAML Controls/Properties/Etc. as currently if you want to add these with a lower Minimum version it has to be from code-behind.
guid	1	smth	I would like to try this out -- making my app an experience shared across multiple close proximity devices but it would be very helpful to see some code samples.
guid	1	smth	There should be alternative condensed and aligned with Win32 style of controls that we can use to create applications that are looking just like their classical counterparts while benefitting from UWP improvements.
guid	1	smth	I belive that Store should control the SDK level more grained.
guid	1	smth	Please add background to TextBlock control.
guid	1	smth	Please integrate ffmpeg or vlc libraries by default in these xaml elements to make it easier for developers to build apps that run all kinds of video and audio files.
guid	1	smth	It would be nice to be able to assign a (compiled) binding to properties through the VisualState Setters of XamlBehaviors.
guid	1	smth	Please add a delegate version for the PropertyMetadata.Create where the DependencyProperty is supplied so you can create a default value for the dependency object instead of a simple default value.
guid	1	smth	Please bring all languages to Cortana for IoT because are needed to create devices for interacting people from around the world.
guid	1	smth	Provide semantic animations like fadeIn fadeout Crossfade etc.
guid	1	smth	Should also do this for other converters for same behavior.
guid	1	smth	If white background scrollbar should be a different color so it is fully visible
guid	1	smth	It would be great to add a property to choose the direction of the progress bar clockwise or counterclockwise.
guid	1	smth	When notifications are removed from one device they should be removed from all devices by default.
guid	1	smth	I know there are no plans for running UWP apps in Windows 7 but a designer would be nice and would virtually remove the need to upgrade to Windows 10 before writing apps for it.
guid	1	smth	Aside from my personal dilemma of a missing device it would definitely make sense to be able testing code in an emulator first instead of having lots of hardware around all the time.
guid	1	smth	If Microsoft fears somebody could use the emulator for playing games on a PC then just turn off games.
guid	1	smth	Please create ActualStartLocation in FileOpenPicker so that we can open the file selection dialog into the exact folder we want.
guid	1	smth	Please add an API that allows to read the temperature from the device (e.g.
guid	1	smth	Please add the ability to access the rendering pipeline to the MapControl class.
guid	1	smth	It would be great if the <Application Executable=launcher.exe> element or the <uap3:Extension Category=windows.appExecutionAlias> element would allow me to specify arguments in the AppxManifest.xml file.
guid	1	smth	So why not include EnablePullToRefresh as a property of MasterDetailsView.
guid	1	smth	It would make developers life much easier if they had a possibility to access files simpler.
guid	1	smth	So my opinion is to create two new controls.
guid	1	smth	It would be great if the Roaming Folder Quota was larger than 100KB (1 MB at least) this would prevent us from having to depend on a network/paid service to have great cross-device customer experiences.
guid	1	smth	This is not really completely UWP related but Microsoft should provide free virtual machines of all Windows 10 versions for testing purposes as in my experience UWP is really fragile and could make my app behave differently in every version.
guid	1	smth	Do you think that you could make the Windows Store and other built-in-apps accessible from the device portal making it a lot easier to install new apps that are already on the store and make changes in settings etc.
guid	1	smth	It would be great if something similar to DependencyObject.SetCurrentValue method from WPF would be introduced in the future so that a DependencyProperty can be set to a new value without missing an one-way binding.
guid	1	smth	Can you please expose the Viseme events for the windows speech sythesis.
guid	1	smth	I think it would be useful to have in the toolkit.
guid	1	smth	it would be great to be able to bind / invoke scripts inside a WebView from a ViewModel (like binding a URL to a Property).
guid	1	smth	Symbol Enum should be updated with latest Segoe MDL2 asset collections.
guid	1	smth	Could you please add SelectRanges(IEnumerabel<ItemIndexRange> itemIndexRanges) to be able to add multiple ranges at once and also make SelectedRanges property is only { get; set; } to be able to replace existing selection ranges
guid	1	smth	After releasing to refresh the list should animate back to top (as a simple list do) and while awaitng for the data to be fetched the Refresh indicator content should be visible or have a property to control its visibility (i would prefer this one)
guid	1	smth	It would be even better if I could have an API that could make the calculations for me and offer up a packet failure/retransmission percent or average time between send and acknowledgment.
guid	1	smth	Optionally the worker side of async / awaitable should accept notification URI in conjunction with Type which ( the Type itself ) may or may not exist on the target of execution in which case it can decide to create exception instance or return typical HTTP message... the important part is the contract of return notification should be extended to the application developer in a way that allows to harvest its result in an expected format potentially by polling yet another resource.
guid	1	smth	But either way please do make an API available.
guid	1	smth	Providing thos apps would boost UWp as platform and thus create more possibilities for Users and Developers together.
guid	1	smth	Please allow private developers to access those capabilities.
guid	1	smth	I hope everyone can publish fonts on the store
guid	1	smth	It would be good for developers to specify auto renewal of the durable paid add-ons in Developer portal so users do not need to repurchase the add-on again and again.
guid	1	smth	A toolbar stacks items from left-to-right and it would be great to have such a toolbar in UWP like we have it today in WPF and several other desktop programming models
guid	1	smth	If you build it it would be great if you could add configurable close-functionality to the tab-header that is bindable to a ViewModel.
guid	1	smth	 ** I think this could be made simpler by support for example a HeaderStyle-Property on the Pivot
guid	1	smth	Maybe the dev should be able to define the panel used for the headers.
guid	1	smth	For a classic desktop application we need a TabControl.
guid	1	smth	So I suggest that you bring the HierarchicalDataTemplate to UWP.
guid	1	smth	Please increase the limit way up or remove it completley.
guid	1	smth	If you add files from across the filesytem which I do in my app... letting the user drop in images and videos from any location you could rapidly hit the 1000 files limit.
guid	1	smth	Increase FutureAccessList limit (like in millions)
guid	1	smth	Also as a secondary request... let FolderPicker.SuggestedStartLocation also be a FolderRelativeId
guid	1	smth	Optional show an user input dialog requesting access to the file or folder and let the user decide.
guid	1	smth	Please add a trigger to start a background task when a nearby NFC tag is recognized.
guid	1	smth	It would be more convenient for the user if my app could react on the NFC tag even when the phone is locked.
guid	1	smth	Add system tray support so that app can be minimised to system tray.
guid	1	smth	You need to provide CoreWindow.Minimise() api in this case.
guid	1	smth	Allow other formats than PCM and float for a FrameOutputNode created with CreateFrameOutputNode of class AudioGraph.
guid	1	smth	This burden would be eliminated would MP3 Frames be available by the FrameOutputNode.
guid	1	smth	Other Formats like MP3 or OGG would be nice.
guid	1	smth	It must be possible to only unload Main UI out of the process without terminating the app service.
guid	1	smth	Allow changing of volume in the Windows Device Portal.
guid	1	smth	Please add the old Silverlight Pivot Control to UWP toolkit.
guid	1	smth	Can you please add an IAP which would have a recurring payment (automatically charge user monthly / annually / etc)?
guid	1	smth	I would like to add a function that automatically loads the lyrics to the song that is played right now.
guid	1	smth	To solve that it would be enough to have read access to the System Media Transport Controls data of other apps.
guid	1	smth	It could be interesting to provide a control to generate and show a Power BI chart inside a UWP application easily with a Control or by code.
guid	1	smth	It would be useful for creating more user-friendly battery related apps that provide better experience for example by refreshing tile or sending notification on the event not some time after it happened.
guid	1	smth	We can also change lock screen background.
guid	1	smth	However it would be useful to get more flexibility.
guid	1	smth	If we could put some templated (or custom) notifications it would save us a lot of work and make lock screen more user friendly.
guid	1	smth	Provide more rich API for text rendering without need to use low-level Direct2D for rich text rendering capabilities.
guid	1	smth	I'd also be happy if MapTileSource property changes (like Bounds) were applied to the map without need to remove the tile source and add it back (this is how it can be done currently).
guid	1	smth	(Compare the UI usage with Google Chrome for example.)
guid	1	smth	Maybe by default the way it looks now but it should have a slider that is magnified if the user taps close to edge of the list and signals its intention to useâ¦ more
guid	1	smth	There is should be a way to include secure data (as strings or byte[]) remotely at dev center as app setting.
guid	1	smth	There is should be way to revoke secure data on server which would require re-publishing app with new set of keys and app with revoked keys should fail on access to secure storage.
guid	1	smth	This data should be accessible from secure key storage immediately after app install and keys should be installed into secure key storage as part of app installation process.
guid	1	smth	Provide ability to deploy an update to certain users only.
guid	1	smth	It would really be great if there was a control which allows to move forward an backward like the Microsoft Edge Browser does with touch input or touchpad input.
guid	1	smth	It should work like a horizontal ListView or GridView...so you can normally scroll through the listed items but when you hit the end of the list and continue scrolling the edge-like part should kick in and navigate you to new or old View/Page/List.
guid	1	smth	I'd love a control that would be a sibling to ListView or GridView only it was backed by a 2D Canvas instead of an ItemsStackPanel.
guid	1	smth	* Allow the placement of rectangular items in 2D
guid	1	smth	(An optional bonus would be to allow the user to rotate the items.)
guid	1	smth	The look and content of the items should of course be customizable.
guid	1	smth	It would be extremely helpful to be able to create MediaSourceStreams for audio streams in the Vorbis and/or Opus formats.
guid	1	smth	DockPanel should be ported to Windows XAML.
guid	1	smth	Currently store access from windows is either enabled or disabled this really needs to be more granular i.e.
guid	1	smth	Should be clear nullable properties in XAML should be supported and not give the error Cannot assign to nullable type on property.
guid	1	smth	Please check and fix this bug as it is causing frustration to Xbox users.
guid	1	smth	For me personally it would be much more convenient to be able to enter my privacy policy content directly into a text field when submitting/updating my app rather than having to provide a URL so I think this should be an option.
guid	1	smth	Allow us to use runtime arguments for Windows.ApplicationModel.FullTrustProcessLauncher.LaunchFullTrustProcessForCurrentAppAsync() in addition to the parameters declared in the manifest
guid	1	smth	In short you could add something like this in your manifest-file:
guid	1	smth	In my case I would also be happy if it was possible to add verbs on all file types but this is something I could live without :).
guid	1	smth	Merging them into a single installer would benefit our users greatly.
guid	1	smth	It seems in order to do that we need to either pull out of the store or convert our desktop app to a uwp and merge the two installers.
guid	1	smth	It would be great if we have an option in disabling the overpanning behavior in ScrollViewer with an API or with any other option to disable it.
guid	1	smth	Net standard should be used by UWP and not limited by it.
guid	1	smth	Because only simple values are supposed to be used as navigation parameters this suggests that a third-party software component must exist for managing the sharing of complex objects between pages.
guid	1	smth	Evidently this is a limitation of the MediaComposition.SaveAsync() API - it should be fixed.
guid	1	smth	If FM radio APIs are brought in it would be amazing if we could get RDS support as well.
guid	1	smth	I believe this should be a user based permission API in case the user doesn't want me to have this ability.
guid	1	smth	I would greatly apperciate if these APIs could be added to UWP.
guid	1	smth	It'd be fantastic if it could be possible to access such data from the converted classic apps.
guid	1	smth	If my app is currently playing audio it would be nice if my app could control the experience and interact how i would want it to outside of the system experience.
guid	1	smth	I would like to control have my app control the vibration/haptic feedback setting.
guid	1	smth	just imagine connecting your phone to a display device and building UWP apps on it it can be the next big thing for developers because no developer wants to carry a 2.5kg laptop wherever he goes...
guid	1	smth	It would be cool to have a option to remove the border and caption of the window so we can make non rectangular windows just like with GDI+ and the Layered Windows API
guid	1	smth	Please expose the DirectX COM API as UWP one having the API coming from Microsoft would be a much better guarantee than relying on third partys or in-house wrappers.
guid	1	smth	Subscribers of the BackRequested event should be notified in stack order instead of queue order.
guid	1	smth	Example: In the UWP Community Toolkit the MasterDetailsView control needs to listen to the back requested event to handle navigating back when in a collapsed state with selection.
guid	1	smth	it would be great if user and dev could modify alarm volume.
guid	1	smth	The best it would be if also dev could set volume granularly on each Toast notification.
guid	1	smth	User might want lower volume for morning alarms and louder volume for alarm used during busy day.
guid	1	smth	Let the user choose between spit-screen or Anaglyph (Red-Cyan).
guid	1	smth	The only workaround so far is to write the text in a Win32/WPF application and then Copy&Paste the text into the appropriate fields which causes a serious security problem when working with critical passwords.
guid	1	smth	Please add full LDAP-Support (Query Read Write).
guid	1	smth	Making it possible for us to write tests and code once and have it being tested in an autonomous way.
guid	1	smth	Provide libraries to help me get started with Project Rome and building a cross-device experience for my application
guid	1	smth	Enable Linux devices to be included in a userâs device graph - to enable discovery launching of apps and communication between connected devices
guid	1	smth	Enable iOS devices to be included in a userâs device graph - to enable discovery launching of apps and communication between connected devices
guid	1	smth	I would like to be able to have screenshots for each and every action for a WinAppDriver like I had with CodedUI via UITestActionLog.html see https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj159363.aspx for what I am looking for.
guid	1	smth	It would be very useful if you allow external devices (e.g through Bluetooth) to control the running audio/video on the phone.
guid	1	smth	Please allow to set the display language of MapControl to one different from Windows display language.
guid	1	smth	Music app can provide to its users an extended network functionality such as audio streaming UPnP/DLNA or SMB/CIFS or FTP client to get music files from server UPnP/DLNA client to send audio data to renderer UPnP/DLNA media server or renderer.
guid	1	smth	It would be useful to have either backgroundNetwork new capability or atleast extend backgroundMediaPlayback capability and if playback is active (which can possibly be using network communication) and app is not suspended keep network communication active.
guid	1	smth	The only option for now would be to make a separate 'Pro' app.
guid	1	smth	Please add an Azure Developer VM for Windows with Unity.
guid	1	smth	The Playback Devices and Recording Devices section should be merged and more info like samplerate channelcount and meters for every input and output should be added with a better UI.
guid	1	smth	It should also be possible to easily select the device where you want to play your system sounds but also to select two channels of a multichannel device if you need your average stereo output for most applications.
guid	1	smth	Therefore it would be nice to have an option like XsltSettings.EnableDocumentFunction Property in .NET apps.
guid	1	smth	Please add ability to Remove Azure AD association.
guid	1	smth	Please add to Manage users Account-level permission Show notifications for disable/enable this option.
guid	1	smth	Adding this may encourage more developers to port their apps to Windows from iOS and make things more familiar.
guid	1	smth	Please provide an API for quiet hours in Windows 10 (mobile) where developers can set the quiet hours parameters from foreground and background.
guid	1	smth	Would it be feasible to somehow make this type of offering as part of the store?
guid	1	smth	The xaml engine of UWP should manage complex types for xaml attributes
guid	1	smth	I suggest to make the xaml engine able to use an interface that lets transcode (convert) an instance to and from a string.
guid	1	smth	Allow the ability to Open the Explorer and show a selected file in the Explorer so that the view is already scrolled to have to file visible.
guid	1	smth	Advanced creation tools need to implement features like the eye dropper which allow the user to select a color on the screen and use it in the application.
guid	1	smth	It would be great if you could request special permission from the User (Like a Notification Manager request) and that would allow the password manager to fill password forms.
guid	1	smth	There would need to be some things that would probably need to be specified for that to work such as specifying a Username textbox.
guid	1	smth	Please add few enhancements so it accepts HTML also or add a converter which may help developers.
guid	1	smth	I suggest making this data more accessible so that servers can be better monitored both to track failures and to inform a cloud system it needs to scale out to more servers.
guid	1	smth	New HTTP Server and HttpListener APIs should be added that surface the failures and request queue state.
guid	1	smth	It would be great to add new status like closed or abandoned
guid	1	smth	Please set a limit and if you are going to ask for a description make it at least 100 or 255 characters long.
guid	1	smth	Windows should allow users to freely redirect media (Audio MIDI even Video someday I guess) from/to the Hardware(audio interface webcam etc) and/or Applications (even considering The Desktop as a video+audio media generator).
guid	1	smth	It could be as simplistic as allowing piping Apps/Devices outputs into Apps/Devices inputs through virtual interfaces managed by the user through a piping routing manager GUI.
guid	1	smth	We are aware of the risk of allowing an app to hide itself from the system but it would be beneficial for security software to have a means of controlling any data that may need to be hidden
guid	1	smth	At this point I think it might be best to just lift the restriction of insider reviews and also show more reviews regardless of version.
guid	1	smth	At the very least don't delete reviews from the dev center even if they're not displayed in the store so we can use them for marketing etc
guid	1	smth	Why dont we support AdjacentToTopDisplayEdge and AdjacentToBottomDisplayEdge too ?
guid	1	smth	2) Make it possible to add the EnvironmentPermission node in the Package.appxmanifest to allow Environment variables to be retrieved.
guid	1	smth	Add this for Side-loaded or enterprise distributed apps on Desktop devices
guid	1	smth	Set up a UWP shell app to test within
guid	1	smth	In addition to existing functionality which allows to collect dump when app crashes it would be nice to have an option to collect dump of running process on Windows 10 Mobile any time you want via device portal.
guid	1	smth	My suggestion is to change the behavior of that triggers or add another pair which will fire on Lock/Unlock transitions.
guid	1	smth	This behavior should be fixed or a new property should be made available in the SDK to enable us to get the user defined settings for regional format.
guid	1	smth	We need a way to have a system wide overlay notification.
guid	1	smth	This could be used in the new Skype Preview app and would be EXTREMLY awesome and powerful.
guid	1	smth	Please update torch driver for these devices we need use torch for our app's
guid	1	smth	Allowing subpixel font rendering would make them look on par with desktop apps.
guid	1	smth	Please increase these limits (Maybe as an opt in).
guid	1	smth	Keep in mind the limits: 100 Command elements in a command set; 10 ListenFor entries in a command; 50 total PhraseList elements; and 2000 total PhraseList items across all PhraseLists.
guid	1	smth	To do so it is crucial we can remove the Close button or complete TitleBar from the TabTip keyboard.
guid	1	smth	Use file playback sample or custom effects sample.
guid	1	smth	And for the consistency of the UI design sometimes it will be nice to allow the app freely styling the buttonsespecially the close button.
guid	1	smth	 For example developers can hide those built-in buttons and draw their own ones and call CoreWindow.Minimize() CoreWindow.Maximize etc.
guid	1	smth	Looking forward to customizable window chrome for UWP apps.
guid	1	smth	An example is in VS I have files copied in during a build process and would like the ability to write against the.
guid	1	smth	So please make All versions the default.
guid	1	smth	can you add a new property in OCR library so that the developers can tell the engine which direction the text was written in?
guid	1	smth	Add support for ngening to the desktop bridge installation.
guid	1	smth	It would be great if MediaControl supported webm format!
guid	1	smth	This property needs to be implemented for mobile as well to enable a true universal app scenario.
guid	1	smth	I would like the ability in XAML to conditionally have my XAML output be compile with flags like you can currently with c#.
guid	1	smth	It would be more useful to be able to sort by Reviews Acquisitions Crashes and Ratings.
guid	1	smth	While this could be also a fix for Roslyn System.Runtime.CSharp.Analyzers the generated Bindings are not the owner of the disposable fields and should just ignore the warnings.
guid	1	smth	Please add Shell Context Menus API for UWP apps.
guid	1	smth	A simple property to set and get focused item would be appreciated.
guid	1	smth	So please add TCP timestamps option support to the StreamSocketControl class.
guid	1	smth	Please add a way to get a storyboard is paused.
guid	1	smth	What would be nice is instead of sending tile notifications for every minute if there was a way to better adjust the live tile image every minute.
guid	1	smth	Please provide a template for DX12 - XAML interop.
guid	1	smth	Once a StorageFile or StorageFolder is allowed to be accessed by the user it SHOULD BE accessible across all those different API.
guid	1	smth	It would be nice to have a command-line tool to submit apps to the store.
guid	1	smth	It would be great to have the ability to hide all apps/categories in with Windows Store and only have it show the Private App store.
guid	1	smth	It would be very useful to add this feature into Hosted Web Apps so that native textboxes in a web application can inherit this capability when converted into a Hosted Web App.
guid	1	smth	Please fix this bug: Once a passwordBox with an InputScope=NumericPin is rendered the keyboard becomes stuck as a number pad and does not return to the full keyboard.
guid	1	smth	The new Notification access is awesome but is it possible to add Overlay UI and  Services  ( you will find it under accessibility settings in Android) to RS2.
guid	1	smth	I really want the Universal Apps to grow more powerful.
guid	1	smth	Solution: when open by a file type association the at least a simple dialog should ask: Allow access to all those file-types or to the folder or only that file.
guid	1	smth	Camera should work when app is minimized.
guid	1	smth	The idea is to segregate the User Interface and business logic such that the user interface will execute on users machine outside of browser/chrome as a standalone application.
guid	1	smth	Make it easier to register for a background task.
guid	1	smth	There are a lot of upcoming features to help with Fluent design and they are really great however to make full use of these the features/xaml/controls need to be backward compatible or do a fallback so that apps that do not target only the latest can also use this.
guid	1	smth	Please review your Package scanning portion of the application.
guid	1	smth	Developers should have the option to opt-out instead of the option to opt-in.
guid	1	smth	Having a device portal across all the different devices is a great idea.
guid	1	smth	Please add an API that allows to read the temperature from the device 
guid	1	smth	Please add an option to get rid of the fade-in animation for opacity.
guid	1	smth	That's why MarkdownTextBlock could offer a way to register some kind of callback function which is called whenever the control comes across a fenced code block with a specified language ID.
guid	1	smth	All I'm asking is when a new version of Windows 10 is released please keep the old VMs still in there.
guid	1	smth	In fact we can use 0xE7D Share with FontIcon element without the enumeration.
guid	1	smth	It would be really cool if I could open a TCP/IP socket and by listening to the raw transmissions and re-send events determine how good the network quality is.
guid	1	smth	The other side of the task should not even expect to notify someone of its progress unless the platform offers capabilities such as SQL Server X-Event Windows Application Event Log or some form of notification.
guid	1	smth	It would also be good for tracking the causes of uninstall spikes etc
guid	1	smth	It would be nice if for adaptive tiles with multiple groups where the current size can't fit all the groups those groups would automatically cycle around (similar to MSN news live tile or calendar app but in this case an individual notification would be cycling rather than a queue of separate notifications)
guid	1	smth	Also it would be great to have the option for paid apps to be a subscription so users are charged periodically to continue using the app.
guid	1	smth	Some apps could benefit from an easy way to not only send a toast notification but also maintain a notification history users could view afterwards.
guid	1	smth	* Implicit DataTemplates (not really an issue of the Pivot but would be great to have these.)
guid	1	smth	A control similar to the FlowDocumentReader/ FlowDocumentScrollViewer would be really awesome!
guid	0	smth	I've had to take ads out of my app to make it run and stop users complaining but now that means no income until this is fixed
guid	0	smth	The control is the equivalent of a pivot table in excelÊ you simply add the datasets with labels and the control sorts out all the selection fieldsÊ visualizations and animations.
guid	1	smth	Please expose Undo/Redo functions on the TextBox control so that we can trigger it programatically.
guid	1	smth	If would like to offer some guides to the user in our own application it could be interesting to have some interesting to be able to show a Popup that give user some indication in the app in a precise scenario (like when discovering a page the first time or when a new feature has been delivered).
guid	1	smth	Allow to mix two app models (JavaScript+WinJS+HTML5 and C#+XAML) inside one application.
guid	1	smth	Make scroll viewers and lists support gestures to scroll to bottom or to top at once.
guid	0	smth	So if a menu is displayed and the user moves the mouse over another menu (without clicking) the first menu would close and the new one hovered over would open.
guid	0	smth	In fact I wonder why MS does not support this FUNDAMENTAL feature while Android and iOS already does.
guid	0	smth	If you create a ListView in an HTML UWP app you can't invoke an item after scolling trough it with your touchscreen.
guid	1	smth	Allow the placement of rectangular items in 2D
guid	1	smth	Make AutoSuggestBox supports AutomationProperties for test automations and accessibility.
guid	1	smth	Currently store access from windows is either enabled or disabled this really needs to be more granular
guid	1	smth	I think that app should have two ratings: one from Windows Phone 8.1 users visible to people having Windows Phone 8.1 and second one from Windows 10 Mobile users visible to Windows 10 users.
guid	0	smth	In the .appxmanifest one can only specify the default colors or a hex value.
guid	1	smth	There should be an option to enter accent to let the default splashscreen have the users accent color.
guid	1	smth	When using a ListView bound to a CollectionViewSource with Grouped items it would be great to have the option to make the Grouped Item selectable/interactive.
guid	1	smth	If i have access to the FM radio APIs i need the ability in my app to force audio to go through the speakers not the headphones.
guid	1	smth	I would like to programmatically set and get the volume for Windows.
guid	1	smth	With Windows 10 Mobile UWP and Continuum Microsoft is focusing on enterprise customers and developers so I think bringing VS to windows mobile through continuum can be game changer.
guid	0	smth	So that in theory our applications could report and find bugs for us.
guid	1	smth	It should also be possible to easily select the device where you want to play your system sounds but also to select two channels
guid	0	smth	Using the CreateRequestAsync method of UserCertificateEnrollmentManager and CertificateEnrollmentManager classes I noticed that the CertificatePropertiesCollection does not give us the capability of specifying enhanced key usage OIDs (for example 1.3.6.1.4.1.311.20.2.2 (SmartCard Logon) 1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3.4 (Secure E-Mail)) basic constraints (like Subject Type=End Entity or Path Length Constraint=none) nor the Subject Alternative Name (like RFC822 DS Object Guid ect).
guid	0	smth	I hope you will take this suggestion in consideration since this feature will be very useful and easy to implement by applications developers.
guid	1	smth	Of course it would be even better to make xaml use TypeConverter additionally for compatibility's sake with WPF.
guid	0	smth	I already know workarounds using Bindings but they are not practical they need more code and they are semantically incorrect (a binding is not a transcoding/conversion they are different by nature).
guid	0	smth	This gives you low latency input in case of a busy UI thread.
guid	1	smth	I think Microsoft needs OR boost XAML development OR if it doesn't interest it open source it then the community can itself improve it...
guid	1	smth	Please revise that value to 12px or provide better representation solution.
guid	1	smth	Any media (Audio/MIDI/Video) generator/consumer (be it an app or an hardware device) should be treated as a freely connectable node instead of an hardwired starting/ending point like today.
guid	0	smth	The documentation indicates that it should be possible to provide an EnvironmentPermission for this to work but out of the box running this code in a UWP project never throws any of the listed exceptions if you don't specify the EnvironmentPermission.
guid	0	smth	Simple usage of the DNS-SD API results in the DNS Client service crashing.
guid	1	smth	Extremely need password protected zipping and unzipping for universal app.
guid	0	smth	It would be much like the Skype for desktop's small call window that comes up when you are in a call.
guid	1	smth	We'd be much happier if we could just avoid defining these macros entirely to avoid any possible issues.
guid	0	smth	PedestrianFeaturesVisible cannot be disabled if MapStyle is set to AerialWithRoads and cannot be enabled if is set to Aerial3DWithRoads.
guid	1	smth	I belive it's critical to make the minimize maximize and close buttons customizable for building a refined UI.
guid	0	smth	WPF apps work much better when ngen'd.
guid	0	smth	I liked the previous Dev Center where I could compare multiple apps on the same graph and just the look in general.
guid	0	smth	There should be a way to define them at once.
guid	1	smth	I'm sure making the interface public would save a number of developers a fair amount of effort and frustration.
guid	0	smth	It worked fairly well on WP8.1 but now on W10M when you go to the start screen until the tile notification refreshes the live tile shows the default app tile.
guid	0	smth	I know I can get server certificates from the server once the request is done but it should have to be done just before sending the info in the SAME request.
guid	1	smth	Please enhance LaunchFolderAsync to accept any IStorageItem (file or folder) as the first argument.
guid	1	smth	Right now we can't able to assign ItemsSource to MapIcon in here map for universal apps please allow to bind so can have easy to implement the apps having multiple Map Icons loads from database.
guid	0	smth	We have to provide different versions of our client application at the same time as converted app in the store.
guid	0	smth	For example if in the msi/ appx is added folder like Samples or Projects it cannot be found by the open/ save dialogs with set Initial Directory opened by the installed executable even if the folder is installed in the installed executable's folder.
guid	1	smth	The new Notification access is awesome but is it possible to add Overlay UI andÊ ServicesÊ ( you will find it under accessibility settings in Android) to RS2.
guid	0	smth	It will make UWP more powerful like win32 and also let dev make some powerful and useful apps likeÊ Universal CopyÊ and 'Native Clipboard .
guid	1	smth	There should be an option if the busness store settings that if checked will send the updated app to the New LOB apps section under manage apps.
guid	1	smth	I wish that garbage collection was optional for C# UWP apps.
guid	1	smth	Add an easy to use and customizable Ribbon control like the ones found in the Office Mobile apps that scales on PCs to Phones.
guid	1	smth	There should be a PowerShell prompt in Device Portal that lets me run extra commands.
guid	1	smth	It should be possible to create Visual Studio Centennial Project in WinForms WPF Win32 MFC etc which should also allow mixing of UWP Code (Like XAML UI) with full interop between native and UWP Platform.
guid	1	smth	Ada 2012 has the ability to express pre- and post-conditions and add them in an easy manner; if these were to be put into the APIs you could block erroneous data from being passed into the API's function which in turn should make things more stable (or at least give more meaningful error-messages than 0x80072f8f 0x800f0906 0xc004f074 and the like).
guid	1	smth	My suggestion is that Microsoft create an Cordova AdControl and Mediation plugin.
guid	0	smth	We frequently need to automate tests that run as different test users so that we can test workflow etc.
guid	1	smth	Allow the developer to query Windows 10 Store with RESTfull API service.
guid	1	smth	Would be nice to have a market place where you can buy sample startersÊ themes and plugins from independent developers.
guid	1	smth	Now that Microsoft has bought Xamarin integrated it in Visual Studio and made it free it would be awesome to replace Xamarin.Forms Xaml syntax with current UWP so that Devs can benefit from all the new rich features such as RelativePanel x:Bind Adaptive Triggers Live Visual Tree etc and also no learning curve for Xamarin.Forms-specific naming conventions (e.g StackLayout instead of StackPanel)
guid	1	smth	I'd like to see support for having winappdriver log to a local file as well as support for setting log levels.
guid	1	smth	Would be nice to have a market place of beautifully designed apps submitted by independent developers.
guid	0	smth	please let me know when you will add more payment options.
guid	0	smth	You could consider doing the same.
guid	0	smth	On the screen Select the features you want to install if I select the Windows Software Development Kit feature at the bottom it installs 1.6GB worth of stuff including headers libraries and source code.
guid	0	smth	If there is no api to access this information enterprise application development with uwp becomes uninteresting.
guid	1	smth	Something that would really give the MapControl a leg up over ESRI would be the ability to create a ShapeFile object and pass it as a parameter to something like: MapElement.CreateElementsFromShapefile(shapefile) and get a list of MapElements that could be added to the map.
guid	1	smth	At least please provide app price conversion list between USD and local currency.
guid	0	smth	Think of foreign developers!
guid	0	smth	It's better if we wake up early.
guid	1	smth	Since most of us don't have a trademark on app names this should be forced by the store (everybody will benefit with this Developers and Microsoft with a cleaner app store).
guid	1	smth	Adding Disqus to the Windows Blog would be a great way to improve developer engagement and build the Windows Developer community.
guid	1	smth	This suggestion is for the Windows Blog and is asking to improve its current commenting system by replacing it with Disqus: https://disqus.com/
guid	0	smth	Trying to bind to a Uri will either throw an exception or give a compiler error (I can't remember which) and certainly won't display an image.
guid	0	smth	You can write your own converter for System.Uri to an image source type but then you have to manually specify the converter on each binding plus you lose any (performance) tweaks MS may have made in their own converter.
guid	1	smth	It might make sense to have another method alongside RequestVerificationAsync that allows consent verification via PIN or password but there needs to be a way to request biometric-only consent verification.
guid	0	smth	Would be great to have these bugs fixed soon.
guid	1	smth	For older browser that do not fully support ES6 the code could be transpiled into ES5 by babeljs traceur etc.
guid	1	smth	I would expect the store to be capable of searching the partial words also or may be give an advance search option where people can tell where the word should be searched.
guid	0	smth	The only workaround provided by MSFT is to manually periodically wake up and reschedule a bunch of notifications ahead of time.
guid	1	smth	If Microsoft really wants to get into the IOT they should really support version 4.2 with IPv6 communication over Bluetooth
guid	0	smth	Start typing something in the search tab and try to scroll to the bottom most element while the inputpane is open you cant see the last element.
guid	0	smth	How to you intend your Surface Pro users to keep the Surface steady with one hand while taking a look at the small preview and clicking on a small button with the other hand?
guid	0	smth	I have some great ideas and working on this since some weeks and when I tried to implement scheduling I was surprised to see that this is not available on Windows.
guid	1	smth	Please make support for setting set AutomationId on CoreWindows and MessageDialog!
guid	1	smth	"Another even better option instead of adding the edit extensibility would be adding an ""open withÉ"" option in the built-in photos app."
guid	1	smth	UWP really needs a way to handle master-details situations easily maybe something like UISplitViewController offered in iOS SDK
guid	0	smth	This can give an app the false impression of being able to modify a non-app calendar (until a Save is attempted and fails with unauthorized exception).
guid	1	smth	Seeing as SplitView is a control used to divide content between and pane and content area it would make sense for SplitView to allow a PanePlacement.Top and PanePlacement.Bottom in addition to its current Left and Right parameters.
guid	1	smth	I would like to recommend adding the ability to upload screenshots in 1080x1920 pixel size.
guid	1	smth	Would be really helpful to have FindAncestor API added just like in Silverlight 5 and WPF.
guid	1	smth	Back to how it was on the old dashboard would be ideal just a simple link to toggle between visible and hidden.
guid	1	smth	I suggest these new maximum lengths: title 500 characters description 10000 characters (same as for app description).
guid	1	smth	You could also consider implementing this partially: for example allow inheritance only between managed WinRT classes and deriving managed classes from native WinRT classes.
guid	0	smth	Please modify like this.
guid	0	smth	You cannot submit any app during this period.
guid	0	smth	If you have any question please contact support.
guid	0	smth	If we try to use one of those it answers with a parameter incorrect without any details.
guid	0	smth	Nevertheless user experience is very bad if the device state is always unknown upfront.
guid	0	smth	Consistency could be ruined if every dev needs to handle manual markup especially as the UI Toolkit
guid	0	smth	The Whiteboard app for example resizes graphic images with pinch/stretch because they have fixed aspect ratios.
guid	0	smth	Example code which registers a service using Windows' DNS-SD APIs:
guid	0	smth	For example: If i want to shut down or take a photo or search for dolphins or want to show the weather to the user or whatever from the uwp app itself.
guid	0	smth	This way the app is very robust and flexible.
guid	0	smth	This way as membership in a group changes the license assignment for app will automatically change.
guid	0	smth	Reason being I do my own 3d rendering without using DirectX for that video portion of my code just Locking the screen DirectDraw surface for it's parameters.
guid	0	smth	However there is no toolkit available for Affinity Designer (which is the only design program besides Adobe XD that is available in the Microsoft Store).
guid	0	smth	The error is in error.
guid	0	smth	I'm okay with a friendly warning perhaps a glyph replacement?
guid	0	smth	Not only will this benefit both Microsoft and Samsung but put more power into the hands of the users and developers of both (which are many many people).
guid	0	smth	Exactly as the title says.
guid	0	smth	Besides it will have a broader reach to consumers.
guid	0	smth	I got several user feedback if I could provide a larger compact overlay.
guid	0	smth	Seems my users would prefer watching a video always-on-top with a larger size.
guid	0	smth	Currently to interact with a DataGrid's rows you must specify a SelectionChanged event.
guid	0	smth	The WPF Grid control had a ShowGridLines property.
guid	0	smth	This property is missing in UWP.
guid	0	smth	It looks that it removes something from the folder but it cannot.
guid	0	smth	After a while the contents start moving but there is no way to move to the very top or very bottom using only the touchpad/mousewheel.
guid	0	smth	There seems to be a bug in DNS-SD where finished services are not actually getting unregistered.
guid	0	smth	I liked Windows 10 Version 1803.
guid	0	smth	I would like to try 1809 or maybe some of the rest of you have.
guid	0	smth	As a developer I am constantly dropping new packages into the Dev Dashboard.
guid	0	smth	Bonus: The cancel button on the upload operation doesn't appear to function either.
guid	0	smth	As an early adopter of the platform I have a number of test apps and/or games.
guid	0	smth	Some of these users are dirtbags and send me garbage feedback like asdfasdfasdf.
guid	0	smth	The page indicates Duplicate email addresses will be removed yet when I paste in duplicate email addresses they remain.
guid	0	smth	What is the problem?
guid	0	smth	The latest OS update to the HoloLens 17134 is missing key features for the Commercial Suite such as Kiosk Mode and others.
guid	0	smth	Your recent upgrade keep killing dwm.exe which it's caused display driver to died.
guid	0	smth	Most of us don't give a care about Apple features we just want controllable situation and not wasting our time trying to delete virus that you recently given to us.
guid	0	smth	No info regarding last update.
guid	0	smth	When you registered with wrong account you need to contact Microsoft support and cancel it and needs to signup with correct Microsoft account again.
guid	1	smth	Allow rotation/scaling of MapIcons so that they stick relative to when the map is rotated.
guid	1	smth	Also would like to place triggers at oom levels but that is a seperate issue.
guid	1	smth	It would be especially powerful and useful to be able to access the DOM that is in the currently loaded page of the WebView control and have full control over querying it and even modifying it if necessary.
guid	1	smth	If all 3 variations could be merged I think most developers would be able to adjust to it and there would be less confusion in the future.
guid	1	smth	The best answer would be to simply exempt installed web apps from the group policy defaults for web pages.
guid	1	smth	And our customers would LOVE to be able to install these apps without having to install Firefox or Chrome first.
guid	1	smth	For exemple the close button could be a top right triangle or larger cube.
guid	1	smth	The old format of showing up to 8 screen shots side by side would give a user a better feel for the app as a whole.
guid	1	smth	We would prefer it either to show the app's page in the store or to not be included in the results at all if it appears to create an error.
guid	1	smth	I think you should provide the option to capture audio with an external mic via the 3.5mm jack(and not through a bluethooth external mic).
guid	1	smth	When running a small SSD for your C drive the emulators can take up a large amount of space so it would be nice to move them to a second hard drive.
guid	1	smth	please make the theme beautiful by making the icons 4d.
guid	1	smth	instead of tiles  we want something attractive for instance Windows style icons more than 3 initial screens customized task-bar the action and notification center should be glass style or in customized transparency style.
guid	0	smth	nfortunately the API does not support that (e.g. it logs off account 1 when logging into account 2)
guid	0	smth	PI uses a WebView-based auth
guid	0	smth	here are a lot of ms-settings:*** commands to launch different settings pages from code on HoloLens but there is no way to call the utilities page under the sysem settings
guid	0	smth	ur primary UWP app is currently compiled as x86 only because there are some limitations of C++ libs we use
guid	0	smth	e've discovered just today that WebGL does not work in WebView in UWP apps compiled as x86 on Windows 10 1803

guid	0	smth	A new version fails the certification process with “10.4.2 App Crash or Freeze
guid	0	smth	ide loadable release builds are also starting and working on our build and test machine
guid	0	smth	This package contains our code compiled with the native tool chain
guid	0	smth	his package does always crash after side loading it
guid	0	smth	o this crash is not the problem reported by the certification process
guid	0	smth	ow things are very complicated
guid	0	smth	 The uploaded “.appxupload” package contains the .NET dlls which are compiled via the native tool chain on the Microsoft certification server which generates a package which fails at startup
guid	0	smth	he same build process on my developer machine with the locally installed native tool chain generates perfectly loadable builds
guid	0	smth	nfortunately there are no more details available from the certification process

guid	0	smth	he test-flight certification process builds the same package internally
guid	0	smth	ortunately it does not try to start the build as part of the certification process

guid	0	smth	o the native tool chain compiles against the wrong entry point which causes the app crash at startup
guid	0	smth	ut why was it working on my local machine
guid	0	smth	his is because I am using Visual Studio 15.7.1 which has already fixed the problem
guid	0	smth	nfortunately the build infrastructure of Microsoft which is used for the UWP certification process (at least for our targeted OS version: Windows 10 falls creators update) uses the buggy version of the SupportedAPIs-x
guid	0	smth	fter I used the latest version of PInvoke.Kernel32.dll which contains a workaround for the problem all was fine

guid	0	smth	owever the placement of the button looks terrible next to the hamburger button
guid	0	smth	 was actually excited to see it was built into the Nav control because i can't figure out where to place the backbutton either such that it doesn;t look weird and out of place... but the built-in nav backbutton doesn't solve the problem either... it still look weird and extreme beta..
guid	0	smth	urrently there's a set of COM APIs that provide access to Virtual Desktop-related features like pinning apps to desktops switching desktops etc
guid	0	smth	nfortunately most of it is undocumented and does not seem to be stabilized (2018 Spring Update for instance changed IApplicationView's CLSID so apps using it stopped working)

guid	0	smth	ileSavePicker just returns a StorageFile class for the file name and extension
guid	0	smth	ssue: I developed a Desktop application saving files with different formats with the same file extension (using SaveFileDialog and FilterIndex) and currently UWP would not allow me to convert the application from Desktop without adding additional menu options or dialogs so the user can chose what he/she wants

guid	0	smth	he users that are already subscribed to the Add-on will keep the same price as before but the new Users will get the new price
guid	0	smth	hat's the reason that currently Microsoft is blocking a price increase
guid	0	smth	t's not really convenient for developers to create every time a new Add-on when they want to increase the price
guid	0	smth	e tried to embrace Microsoft's vision for UWP but failed misreably wasting lots of time and money
guid	0	smth	e built a UWP application that reads public data off ISO 7816 smart cards successfully until we realized that the app fails to function in release mode
guid	0	smth	n debug mode it all works fine
guid	0	smth	n release mode we generate the appx and it passes windows certification
guid	0	smth	he smartcard functionality however which is based on a .net standard 2.0 library fails to work (https://github.com/danm-de/pcsc-sharp
guid	0	smth	e are now trying to use the native UWP SmartCard API but its largely useless as we cannot find any methods to construct and transmit APDU which are the basic communication bloc

guid	0	smth	n Windows 10 UWP apps if you rapidly click or unintentionally double-click on any control supporting click/tapped event its associated Click event handler will execute for each
guid	0	smth	his can cause a lot of unintended side effects
guid	0	smth	or example if the Click event handler brings up a modal ContentDialog with the ShowAsync command an additional click will cause the event handler to fire again before modal isolation occurs and create another ContentDialog which causes an exception if not handled will result in a crash of the application

guid	0	smth	t used to do this in Windows 8 and early Windows 10 versions but this apparently changed a while ago
guid	0	smth	his will be a good addition
guid	0	smth	t is understandable that when UWP app is run normally it can only access a limited set of COM objects; however if the UWP is packaged to desktop bridge it makes sense to allow it to access additional COM objects exposed by that desktop bridge using the technical described in the blog above
guid	0	smth	ithout this support if a desktop bridge contains a UWP app and a win32 app exposes out-of-proc COM objects the only way UWP app can communicate with the win32 app is through AppService
guid	0	smth	his brings a lot of overhead and unnecessary work to add AppService into win32 app and sometimes it is impossible if win32 source code is not available
guid	0	smth	ackaged COM (https://blogs.windows.com/buildingapps/2017/04/13/com-server-ole-document-support-desktop-bridge/#KgekWJeWFmOwUZRb.97) allows exposing out-of-proc COM objects using desktop bridge however these COM objects are not accessible from UWP apps even if the UWP apps are packaged into same desktop bridge exposes the COM objects
guid	0	smth	e are a dev house that specialises in publishing dedicated Xbox Apps
guid	0	smth	t used to be that there was a really high standard to get certified on Xbox which was tough to get through but at least the standard of apps was pretty high
guid	0	smth	ow it seems there is zero standard to be certified to publish an app on Xbox and by default EVERY windows 10 app that is published is published on all devices
guid	0	smth	 know microsoft is trying to flesh out the app stores on each device - but it means that when we publish an app now our app is barely out a day and it is pushed way down the new apps list - making it almost impossible to generate organic downloads from curious users
guid	0	smth	hat is fine if we are being kept out by other Xbox apps - but we released an app last week and currently there are about 2 dozens apps ahead of us - half that won't even work on an Xbox with a controller
guid	0	smth	t is totally crazy and really counterproductive to building any kind of a vibrant ecosystem
guid	0	smth	ne simple example is there is a PDF database app on the new apps list on XBOX
guid	0	smth	ou cannot use it it cannot access files and it has absolutely no viable function on Xbox One
guid	0	smth	et somehow this passes certification and is thrown on the pile of rubbish that now clutters the new app section
guid	0	smth	t is hugely frustrating to put months of work into building an app for xbox and stand no chance of getting it downloaded because nobody will ever be able to find it

guid	0	smth	un this as many times as you like the create date will not change from the first time you ran the code
guid	0	smth	t deletes the file
guid	1	smth	aving SOCK_SEQPACKET would remove the burden of distinguishing between independent messages from the user
guid	0	smth	t also allows greater compatibility for existing POSIX-compatible applications as was the original goal for implementing AF_UNIX
guid	0	smth	his would be comparable to the message mode of Windows named pipes making AF_UNIX sockets a more complete replacement
guid	0	smth	ome users certainly will find this useful
guid	0	smth	adly if you're someone who finds this annoying there's no option to disable this behavior
guid	0	smth	ccording to the singular post I was able to find on this new feature (https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/forum/insider_wintp-insider_desktop/programs-autostart-after-boot-in-windows-10/09dd8d3e-7b36-45d1-9181-6587dd5d53ab?page=2&auth=1) there is no way to disable this
guid	0	smth	he new fall creators update seems to have introduced a 'feature' where if a user reboots the system any applications that were open (well some at least it seems as though to make this issue even more confusing not all applications follow this convention) will automatically launch on reboot
guid	0	smth	thers may find this annoying
guid	0	smth	t currently only supports octet-stream
guid	0	smth	n trying to use SHA2 Timestamp(current Microsoft guidelines) servers the powershell cmdlet set-authenticodesignature fails to apply the timestamp
guid	0	smth	his cmdlet uses the cryptuiwiz api

guid	0	smth	ctually we can't because the same notification would be send too if the user is closing the application
guid	0	smth	his issue was reported for Visual Studio Feedback Site but They have determined that this issue belongs to universal windows platform
guid	0	smth	urrently we have no notifying system to the developers when the customer add new feedback to the feedback hub
guid	0	smth	t's tooo painful
guid	1	smth	s it possible to add the notification system
guid	0	smth	servoice already have it

guid	0	smth	reate a new blank UWP application and add this XAML code
guid	0	smth	hen I run this I expect to get no suggestions in the software keyboard when writing anything in the text box
guid	0	smth	his works as expected on phones but not on computers/tablets
guid	0	smth	'm using Fall Creators update not sure how it behaves in other versions
guid	0	smth	n my case I'm writing an app where you learn how to spell and don't want to give the user any hints :-
guid	0	smth	e are developing components on Linux which has dedicated system call and memory requests
guid	0	smth	his would signify communication and access on the file system
guid	0	smth	 have some more feature recommendations regarding extensions in adaptivegridview if you will
guid	0	smth	nd this grouping will obviously include the semantic zoom feature as well
guid	0	smth	ncremental Loading: I know this is already in the community toolkit
guid	0	smth	orting : sorting with 1 or more properties
guid	1	smth	ist/GridSwitcher : there can be a toggle button on the top of the control which can toggle the control to view as a listview ( each item expanded fully ) or to a gridview ( normal grid like behaviour 
guid	0	smth	hese are some of the most common scenarios which are required by developers and there are many ways to do it but this can get very complicated to align them with best practices
guid	0	smth	his can be a very powerful control/page yet looking very good to the eye as well
guid	0	smth	his search bar auto filters the items on basis of the filterDescriptor provided ( filter descriptor can be defined by the developer tht which stringtimeint property to match with which condition i.e : Contains startswith endswith e.t.c
guid	0	smth	 have used Unity+UWP to develop LOB application that visualizes 3D data from opened files
guid	0	smth	e also use multiple-top-level windows that are already available
guid	0	smth	 have a disk imaging (which I have already converted) application that writes bytes directly to disk (USB and SD cards)
guid	0	smth	he app gets rejected during submission to the store as some features are disabled as admin privileges are required
guid	0	smth	o in a round about way you're actually raising the chances of users getting viruses by blocking these apps as they just get them from the web instead
guid	0	smth	urrent clipboard API can notify about a clipboard content change which is fine
guid	0	smth	his limitation results in a bad user experience because there are scenarios where the user is working with one application and another application performs some operations based on the copied content
guid	0	smth	ut getting or setting the content doesn't work if the app is in background or unfocused
guid	0	smth	r the other way around; where one application creates data and sets the content automatically and the user can directly use it inside another application
guid	0	smth	urrently the input will be validated if the focus of the Textbox lost
guid	0	smth	 can verify that this works
guid	0	smth	ut unfortunately it is not possible to create a MediaStreamSample from D3D Surface
guid	0	smth	his will allow us to do full hardware accelerated video decoding
guid	0	smth	:Bind is great and I love it
guid	0	smth	) This limit appears to be arbitrary and not on par with other platforms (iOS / Android / Mac OSX)
guid	0	smth	his limitation is a contribution to a diminished user experience (and developer experience) when compared to these other platforms
guid	0	smth	his idea is so bad on so many levels
guid	0	smth	o what is the suggestion
guid	0	smth	s a Xamarin.Forms developer I had to drill down 4 frameworks to find this limitation
guid	0	smth	s bad as the Android docs are they at least make an effort to publish limits
guid	0	smth	) DO NOT SUGGEST a steam roller as a work around to a shortcoming in a fly swatter
guid	0	smth	specially if that steam roller is riddled with security issues and complexity way beyond the experience and latitude of most fly swatter users
guid	0	smth	n [this](https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/sqlserver/en-US/6187a2cc-2683-4b15-b1e6-d90f3703ad0b/uwp-c-emailmanager-message-body-getting-truncated?forum=wpdevelop&prof=required) following forum post the character limit for an email body generated via code from an app is noted
guid	0	smth	ontentDialog is currently far too difficult to use for two reasons: locking and placement
guid	1	smth	ince only one ContentDialog can be shown at a time a lock is needed (such as SemaphoreSlim(11) or a sequential queue of TaskCompletionSource)
guid	0	smth	n other words the class is not complete because normal use of it requires wrapping it in additional code
guid	0	smth	his means that ContentDialog.ShowAsync will wait until any currently-displayed ContentDialog is dismissed before showing the new dialog
guid	0	smth	f ShowAsync() or ShowAsync( ContentDialogPlacement.Popup) is used then the location of the dialog is not well controlled
guid	0	smth	n the other hand if ShowAsync( ContentDialogPlacement.InPlace) is used then (a) it is not convenient because one must separately embed the dialog in XAML and (b) it doesn't always work because an exception occurs if ShowAsync(InPlace) is called on the dialog before the XAML is fully loaded
guid	0	smth	or example an error dialog that is required early during program startup cannot be shown based on a copy embedded in XAML
guid	0	smth	In addition per (1) above a lock of some kind is needed)
guid	0	smth	urrently when the last element(s) of the tile doesn't fit (because of users with unusual scaling settings for example) it get's discarded out of view which is understandable
guid	0	smth	t also helps with dealing with the scenario where because of the users scaling settings there is too much space on the tile where the developer could have shown extra info
guid	0	smth	asswordVault.FindAllByResource throws a COMException when there are no credentials for the resource (or maybe only when there are no credentials)
guid	0	smth	t should return an empty list without throwing an exception
guid	0	smth	ight now the window.closed event for desktop fires both for minimization and for closing events
guid	0	smth	 understand this is done because of the multiplatform support but it just makes desktop apps with multiple Windows harder 5o manage so please
guid	0	smth	 good web example can be found here https://material.angular.io/components/chips/overvie
guid	0	smth	e are able to download previous versions of the release versions of the Windows SDK
guid	0	smth	n the slow ring we are currently on Windows build 17025 but the only SDK download link provided on the Windows Insider download page is for 17061 at time of writing
guid	0	smth	 am not willing to go to fast ring because this renders my laptop useless
guid	0	smth	hen you invoke the primary or secondary buttons in a ContentDialog you are not losing focus in the control that was last being edited
guid	0	smth	f you are using x:Bind to bind that control's value to a property in the ContentDialog code-behind page then when you press the primary button the property doesn't get updated
guid	0	smth	've tried forcing the control (in this case a TextBox) to lose focus programmatically in the Primary buttonevent handler but this does not help
guid	0	smth	ve also tried Bindings.Update - bit this does not help either
guid	0	smth	he expected behaviour is that when you click on the Primar
guid	0	smth	here are thousands of programmists here too
guid	0	smth	urrently there does not appear to be a way to set a window's startup position (left top width/right height/bottom) beyond full-screen and/or maximized
guid	0	smth	lso the last used position for a given window isn't saved intrinsically
guid	0	smth	indows launch at random places on the desktop
guid	0	smth	 understand this need does not really exist for mobile
guid	0	smth	ut for many desktop applications specifically container applications managing windows is a core feature objective
guid	0	smth	t is similar like this issue : http://www.dcfever.com/cameras/specification.php?id=162
guid	0	smth	e've inherit a control from Slider and put it in horizontal
guid	0	smth	f Windows set to 125% DPI and when slider value is the same as its maximum value
guid	0	smth	ur App would crash
guid	0	smth	f we use Application.ExecutablePath when the user open the Shortcut he gets an access permission error so I'm trying to create it using shell:AppsFolder\ but I can't get the AppUserModelI

guid	0	smth	ditor is the value of x:Name given to RichEditBox element
guid	0	smth	icrosoft has added in the Camera App the Panorama Mode which works in some devices and tablets
guid	0	smth	on't know if it is a specific number of devices that currently this feature works
guid	0	smth	s this possible to use this feature in our Windows App Store Universal Apps and if we can  do we have any sample code to accomplish this 
guid	0	smth	on't want a solution with the scrollviewer and the compass because I have already done that
guid	1	smth	he app list should be in grid style and background should be customized
guid	1	smth	he keyborad should also be customized like the gadget comfort on-screen keyboard in windows 7 (desktop)
guid	1	smth	lease allow us to maintain all app packages store assets descriptions screenshots and metadata in a Git repository and simply push to a Git remote to upload
guid	1	smth	nstead we could get everything ready locally and do a push and upload it all quickly
guid	1	smth	hat I would like to see is a button on the language description pages that are supported for an app
guid	0	smth	nd put it onto the description field for Japanese for example) For my app I have it in about 36 language/Country descriptions which is a big task to handle
guid	0	smth	he user could then review the translations as best as they could
guid	0	smth	nd if Microsoft couldn't translate it it could just copy over the original text
guid	0	smth	hat would take your default language description and fields and then use Microsoft's Translator to translate all the fields to the language
guid	1	smth	lease add support C++/CX extension and type system for Desktop platform
guid	1	smth	nd it's good if it will be work on Windows 7 too
guid	1	smth	lease comment and document this behavio
guid	1	smth	herefore I want to request adding of some improvements in WinRT API to bring Frame's behavior closer to it's analog from WP Silverlight
guid	0	smth	o would be great if Microsoft things in this way also
guid	0	smth	t should be typed as it is typed in Gujarati 'દ્વિ'
guid	1	smth	t would be great to have a Background Trigger when that data was changed on another device
guid	1	smth	t is great that we can Schedule Tile updates so that I can always show the latest timings on the tile itself but I would love it if I could do the same thing with Badges
guid	0	smth	ttempting to use TextAlignment within Page.Resources and referencing it via StaticResource in a Universal Windows App will compile but throw an exception
guid	1	smth	hen Cortana has an expression that it doesn't understand based on the available expressions registered but Cortana does recognize an app name it would be great if the user's expression was fed to the app account on the store for the developer to review and consider supporting in the future
guid	1	smth	indow should stay the size I left it
guid	1	smth	lease add CAN API to be included in the Windows.Devices
guid	0	smth	ompanies like CSHTML5 (http://cshtml5.com) and DuoCode (http://duoco.de) are already doing this but it would be great to see this effort officially adopted into the Microsoft Universal Windows Platform
guid	1	smth	 mechanism that operates like PhoneGap/Cordova would have to be implemented so that access to external hardware APIs can be achieved
guid	0	smth	ope there are some automated tool for taking localised screenshots
guid	1	smth	n the upload website a way to remove all screenshots and a way to upload all assets for all languages at once
guid	1	smth	t is very important that we support beta for both Windows Phone and Windows
guid	1	smth	llow users of paint to select parts of images on an image they're drawing or editing diagonally other than only horizontally/vertically
guid	1	smth	ou could even make it possible to select the angle at which you select a certain part of the image manually and this would certainly make editing in paint a lot easier
guid	1	smth	lease provide the ability to the developer to change the color of the keyboard inside their app
guid	0	smth	ow this may not be so bad in English which has relatively short words but languages like German or Danish make heavy use of compound words
guid	1	smth	ords can get very long and thus hyphenation is needed - especially on small screens
guid	1	smth	PI to detect incoming call and number so it can be blocked if not necessary and also can ring even in silent if it is important
guid	1	smth	t would be great to have the option for creating Publisher’s shared roaming folder as well
guid	1	smth	pen sideloading for everyone
guid	1	smth	t would be better if this file was in JSON format and followed the Manifest for web application standard from W3C: http://www.w3.org/TR/appmanifest
guid	1	smth	llow changing country and publisher name after registration on the Stor
guid	1	smth	lease either extend the existing class to consider the use cases for the phone or ditch it and come up with something more like Apple's approach which works better than what's currently there
guid	0	smth	nfortunately this means the app is a none-starter because the files can be several gigabytes in size so it kills the user experience everytime they try to open a file
guid	1	smth	he Emulator should support SensorSD
guid	1	smth	 propose you add a proper unit test suite for the WinJS platform that can be automated and ideally run from common JavaScript tools like Grunt
guid	1	smth	lease document how transitions work and expose the necessary API for us to create our own drop in replacements for the limited set of transitions supplied by the existing APIs
guid	0	smth	or example on WP if I want to use a custom transition I can fake the transition by using animations at the exit and entry to a page but in order for this to work I need to remove the existing stack of transitions from the frame because navigation will reuse the last transition from the frame's collection
guid	1	smth	t the very least we need a No Op transition that can be used to prevent the frame's stack from using the last transition to animate the page change
guid	1	smth	his feature is to ask for Xaml serialization featureset parity with WPF/System.Xaml
guid	1	smth	t could be better to have search box in windows phone application instead of having it in windows application alone
guid	0	smth	uto focusing the input element in page ready is not working in windows mobile application
guid	1	smth	s a developer I should have access to the entire WinRT API if I am building an app for my own personal device
guid	1	smth	erhaps more developers would build for Windows if they can build their own tools for personal use without so many restrictions
guid	1	smth	his is an excellent feature but I would love to see the same tools and support available for the shared project in a universal WinJS app
guid	1	smth	t would be great to use Bower to install scripts once into the shared project rather than installing two copies of the same script into the Windows project and the Windows Phone project
guid	1	smth	t makes sense to disallow universal C#/Xaml apps installing packages to the shared project because they might only target Windows 8 or only target Windows Phone
guid	0	smth	herefore there should be no problem with installing scripts directly to the shared project using Bower instead of installing two copies of the same script to two different projects
guid	1	smth	t would make sense i think that en (no region) language will be used as a fallback for all en countries if there is no en-region specified
guid	1	smth	lso we need a supplementary fix to the issues faced by existing affected users without resorting them to contacting Microsoft customer support to restore their purchase by way of adding credit to re-purchase the app
guid	0	smth	f you add more than a few like 25+ the performance is so bad that you have to wait for a few seconds after you stop to be sure that the pins/controls are in the right position
guid	1	smth	ither use the Identity version throughout the Store and let us change that with the Visual Studio Wizard or ensure that the Dev Center reads the Package version (rather than Identity version)
guid	0	smth	isual Studio's Create Package wizard allows one to assign a version number however this assigns the Package version number
guid	1	smth	 would like some way so that I can have my various devices (each with different form factor) get the latest build deployed to them all or a select number of them instead of debugging simply failing
guid	1	smth	ubCenter users should be able to decide how much they want to receive when they get a payment
guid	1	smth	t would be great if I could decide to receive less money in a single payment and keep the rest for the next year
guid	1	smth	xpose an API that allows apps aside Phone and Messaging to trigger Person reminders
guid	1	smth	olish your new Contact Manager api to get the maximum performance .Hence the user not to sit idle till it loads
guid	0	smth	t may be based on number only contacts contacts with email address or filtering only phone contacts other than any social contacts etc
guid	0	smth	lease consider my suggestion on this cas
guid	1	smth	lease provide a simpler example with a clearer coding
guid	1	smth	 think it is good to explain what is default image
guid	1	smth	lease provide support for adding developer user id to Windows Developer account
guid	1	smth	ope that Microsoft (if possible) allow us individuals to create individual developer account for FREE and allowed only to publish one app on Windows Phone or Windows store
guid	1	smth	lso add the same LIVE profile password change link to the Windows Store profile
guid	1	smth	llow background services to display controls on top of other applications
guid	1	smth	t would be great to for example play a video in a small square box while browsing the web or respond to messages without having to open a message app
guid	1	smth	lease support m3u8 live streaming
guid	1	smth	lease Please Please expand the 'Email Signature' function so that you are able to include a detailed signature including embeded images
guid	1	smth	y using the FileOpenPicker class we can filter shown files by extensión but I think we should also be able to filter files by their name let's say: I only want to show pictures whose name start with ABCD or whose name ends with  BCD
guid	0	smth	o Please Provide this option
guid	1	smth	he dev team should be able to access info through the dashboard

guid	1	smth	icrosoft could have created more tools for integrating NHibernate easily into .net apps but they developed EntityFramework instead… mor
guid	1	smth	ust like in WinRT could we have Spell Checking options and Text Prediction in Window Phone Silverlight apps
guid	0	smth	 was working on clipboard manager application for windows 8 and discovered that there is no way to catch Clipboard.ContentChanged event when application is running in background seems the life cycle of WinRT app doesn't allow this
guid	1	smth	ish I would have a possibility to create a background task that is triggered by clipboard content changed system event
guid	1	smth	dd WebP support so I can easily process and export images using the format
guid	1	smth	e want access to every camera available at same tima
guid	1	smth	 think there should be a property (maybe something like ShowDeleteButton) that allows you to specify whether the Delete button is displayed
guid	0	smth	/B testing is crucial for quantitative marketing
guid	1	smth	et the local apps install without need to access to windows phone store just like .exe files in windows..
guid	0	smth	fter profiling the app I found that after calling MediaCapture.capturePhotoToStorageFileAsync method memory is not released and allocates 10-20 MB with each call
guid	0	smth	've also voted for this suggestion as that could fix most of camera related issues on Windows phone
guid	0	smth	he only way to detect it is by looking for UnauthorizedException but that exception is ambiguous
guid	0	smth	 location permission dialog may be showing when a network error occurs in an unrelated part of the code for example
guid	1	smth	erhaps ensuring a 1 year gap between signups would be enough of a deterrent to those that may want to maliciously close their account regularly
guid	1	smth	lease include my country Yemen in pay out and advertisement too
guid	1	smth	atePicker should be allowed to have a null value initially and not a programmatically set that could accidentally be mistake for a user's input
guid	0	smth	etting DayVisible to false prevents the spinner from showing which is nice but then the date is displayed when the value is shown in the field which sort of negates the feature
guid	1	smth	t would be nice if an app could provide its own tasks / todos to the OS
guid	1	smth	 do alot of copying and pasting and would really like to see a customized copy and paste built into windows
guid	0	smth	hat way when I paste I still have the other files in memory to paste elsewhere
guid	1	smth	f I can copy like say 4 - 10 different files/folders it would be nice to have a selection when I right click and place my mouse over paste I would like to see a Paste - All Paste select which would have check boxes on each folder/file I have selected to copy
guid	1	smth	lease provide APIs and support of iBeacons technology and also BLE scanning without pairing just like using Advertising Package so that we can exchange data to or from target device
guid	1	smth	eplace Most Used Tags/attributes With Number
guid	0	smth	ll the developers needs to do is some thing like this

guid	1	smth	ubcenter Ads should not play sound unless clicked on or have a way to mute ad sounds
guid	0	smth	ou might throw up a MessageDialog in the catch clause
guid	1	smth	t would be nice to have a ShowForAsyncAction method or something so that you have one call and don't have to worry about cleanup
guid	1	smth	t would be nice to have one thing with three states rather than two things who have two states each
guid	0	smth	evelopers need to write additional code -using the deprecated DirectInput API- to access those devices even though Microsoft states that use of DirectInput should be avoided and XInput used instead for any gamepad functionality
guid	1	smth	here should be an update to XInput API that will add functions so to migrate and simplify that functionality from DirectInput
guid	1	smth	ou should also be able to undelete an app package for 24 hours after you delete
guid	1	smth	ou should also be able make a backup of this information so if it does get delete you can always restore it
guid	0	smth	or the testcase source code see below
guid	1	smth	ou should officially support Windows Template Library (WTL) and make it the first class native Windows API framework replacing the aging MFC

guid	0	smth	his capability is needed for third party apps also
guid	1	smth	ow since Cortana does this already please pass us the parsed NLP string with identified pronouns with grammatical breakdown

guid	1	smth	 like the ability for apps to connect to the people hub and show items in the news feed but there are some things that are really annoying to consumers and could be solved with a few APIs

guid	1	smth	ell I think that the devcenter app should be updated/extended so that the app can show the windows store apps as well as the phone apps (which it currently does) Ideally it should also use the live tiles to show the current stats on your apps
guid	1	smth	uggestion: Show exactly that error message in the Windows Store dashboard
guid	1	smth	 single line should go through all the months regardless of the release or at least we should be able to turn that filter on or off
guid	1	smth	 am asking whoever checks or tests it put more information of their findings rather than giving the developers generic policy numbers like 1.1 or 3.6
guid	1	smth	hen utilizing the File Picker and specifying one or more extensions the dialog that gets shown to the user should filter to these extensions not show everything but only have those items selectable
guid	1	smth	et people inherit from EasingFunctionBase because Microsoft you do not have infinite wisdom and the predefined list of easing functions you give everyone doesn't have the one I need
guid	1	smth	lease expand your search range to at least the top 100-200 apps
guid	1	smth	lease update the Windows SDK and Windows App Certification Kit to allow us to use Win32 PrefetchVirtualMemory function: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/hh780543(v=vs.85).asp
guid	1	smth	 think that having and IAP price point of $0.49 could be wildly attractive to end users and get more purchases for developers
guid	1	smth	'd like to be able to ping for nearby devices running an app using PeerfFinder but while the app is not in the foreground
guid	1	smth	ould it be practical to make it so that a user could authorize proximity tracking in the background so that an app could utilize it
guid	1	smth	ake possible to add a range of list<mapicon> to make it faster and optimize
guid	1	smth	rovide computer vision APIs that would allow developers to get access to functions such as motion tracking facial/gesture/voice recognition egomotion structures from motion and object identification etc
guid	1	smth	ivot and panorama controls should have options to enable/disable wrapping
guid	1	smth	lso the scroll viewer should have options to disable overscrolling effect
guid	1	smth	lease cant we have an option in the WPAppManifest file to untick fast resume and allow WP8.1 apps to not run in fast resume mode just like in WP8
guid	1	smth	icrosoft should provide a better beta program for developers and user like the one in android in which you don't have to download a separate app  you update the stable one to the beta in the store
guid	1	smth	llowing to prefetch an ad allow the developer to optimise his ad strategy
guid	1	smth	t will be useful if we can set the reminder tone to vibrate so that not every reminder would beep when you're in a meeting
guid	1	smth	t times you may want to set a reminder and let it vibrate in your pocket still giving only you a notification instead of beeping out loud when you don't want it to
guid	1	smth	or one of our products we need to support NFC card reading/writing with existing devices and several types of cards (Mifare UL ULC Calypso Desfire maybe even more
guid	1	smth	S2013 could create those folders in each project and bring in the classes (pages and user controls) from the original project
guid	1	smth	lease add recent places to SuggestedStartLocation in FileOpenPicker API
guid	1	smth	lease implement the HttpListener class so that we can run REST based controls (similar to Xbox Smartglass) for our own apps
guid	1	smth	et normal http:// URIs to be able to send notifications to the app using the window.external.notify and not only the https:// URIs
guid	1	smth	ive the power to the developer to decide if a page is allowed to use the ScriptNotify event or not
guid	1	smth	nd my only wish is to format a DateTime like the user wants to see it
guid	1	smth	ould you please add programmiatic printing to the WinRT API
guid	0	smth	nder WPF it is possible to initiate printing to the default printer by simply calling Print() on a properly configured PrintDocument object
guid	0	smth	n order to print the guests must leave the tailored kiosk experience and interact with the local print dialog

guid	1	smth	t would be good if we can at least optionally reduce the speed of the emulator to better reproduce real world devices
guid	0	smth	echnically everything went smoothly but when I tried to submit the update it required that I reserved a name
guid	1	smth	lease provide access to Calendar API to customize the day styles basing upon requiremen
guid	1	smth	'd like a way to access the deviceExtendedProperties specifically the ANID2 in a Windows Store App
guid	1	smth	y proposal is an API out of StorageFolder to retrieve a StorageItem given a relative path from that StorageFolder
guid	1	smth	y suggestion is that when a payment is being processed this should be indicated on the Financial report which include the expected date it will arrive and the exact amount being processed
guid	1	smth	 would suggest you look into AdMob/AdSense reporting for inspiration as it's very convenience and everything a developer want to know about payments is easily accessible
guid	1	smth	t would be nice to have such an API in WinRT so we don't have to resort to native DirectX each time we need something more than a couple of shapes
guid	1	smth	hat I want is the ability to record those alongside system-provided ETW events so that I can see how my code's activity fits in with system behaviour
guid	1	smth	 would like to have better access to Lockscreen so that I can completely customize it which includes how the time is displayed any custom content like photos or news wallpaper
guid	1	smth	t should also allow a timer based updation
guid	1	smth	bviously there should probably be a PIN requirement for first use/set up trust but the NFC capabilities of the WP platform will never be fully realized until a simple tap can make something happen without user interference
guid	0	smth	 think this is a bug because I think if the WriteableBitmap decides to update the PixelWidth and PixelHeight property it should also update the PixelBuffer or the data is inconsistent
guid	1	smth	ake multitasking a real thing like seeing a video or having a mini calc when browse some thing
guid	1	smth	ive tiles are fine but we need a true way to make tiles more dynamic and that would be accomplished with a widget application template
guid	1	smth	n a similar way to the new lock-screen apps allow developers to create an app that runs inside a tile of larger dimensions that then current pre-defined tile sizes
guid	1	smth	he app should have full access to touch events on the tile so it can respond to them
guid	1	smth	llow apps to act as data sources for other apps
guid	1	smth	uild on WCF to allow on-phone app-to-app communication
guid	1	smth	llow JSON and/or XML to pass data between apps
guid	1	smth	ake apps request permission the first time they talk to a new app then let it happen in the background
guid	1	smth	e need IO Brokers to enable copy and paste scenarios in Universal App in Phone and tablet
guid	1	smth	e need real Background Download Broker so we can have torrent or custom Download scenarios (some of them may not apply to specific form factor
guid	1	smth	nclude an API to add remove deactivate tracking protection lists (TPL) to further drive down data usage enable selective protection against rogue sites tracking and just having a sense of control
guid	1	smth	t is better if developers can start their app from background i mean one develops an app that has permission to start itself when it receives a notification
guid	1	smth	 understand power consumption is a consideration but a more balanced middle ground like only allowing more intensive background tasks when the system is plugged in and/or giving users clear indications such activity is occurring (liek Android does in its notification bar) so that they know why battery life is being impacted would make the WinRT environment much more useful and in turn drive adoption
guid	1	smth	t would be great for a permanently running app to have an API which notifies it when an update is available to notify when an update is forced to permit the app to check for an update easily and also to permit the app execute the update
guid	1	smth	ould become even more useful if say i could share to reading list from chrome extension or mac desktop or iOs
guid	1	smth	e need the PivotViewer control for WPF and WinRT please
guid	1	smth	 think that a wise addition would be to create a Universal search platform that when enabled a single tap on the Search button will bring up only a search bar and with that the user would search for content inside the app (and by content I'm talking specifically for app content)
guid	0	smth	f I use this XAML definition it work but the groupheader is not wide as the listview
guid	0	smth	ith MaxNumberOfColums you can limit the number of columns
guid	0	smth	in8 applications need to be more productive for businesses
guid	1	smth	llow XAML winRT apps to change the lock screen background
guid	1	smth	t would be much more comfortable to be able to read the entire notification in the center of notifications for wp8.
guid	1	smth	e responsible and give more & specific details why an app failed rather than pointing a policies which talks about several things
guid	1	smth	s with CSS it would be very useful if we could set text based framework elements to be UPPERCASE lowercase Title Case etc with a TextTransform property in Xaml
guid	1	smth	lease remove that validation or validate according with my tax plan and not my country in the account
guid	1	smth	he point is to make the app universal across devices so that our engineers do not have to spend too much time learning and relearning the controls
guid	1	smth	lease allow windows phone 8.1 file/folder picker to have access to onedrive and store the location in futureaccesslist
guid	1	smth	ecause of windows 8.1 and windows phone 8.1 universal app I am hoping to adapt the app to windows phone as well
guid	1	smth	ake SD boot fresh each time phone is restarted or double files with nothing in them to play then error 8007005
guid	1	smth	rompt all users with a warning that they should make sure that the VPN is disabled before proceeding... including most users who have not enabled a VPN in the first place... and popping such a message almost every time the app is launched
guid	1	smth	e-write large portions of code as native code and use the Winsock APIs instead of the WinRT
guid	1	smth	ake Bing Vision lens in the camera app pinnable to Start for quick access again and/or add it to the Cortana screen to the left of the Music Search button perhaps
guid	1	smth	lease add the From To options right after Download new email under each email account to specify when the phone is allowed to check emails
guid	1	smth	he Online Media extensibility is fantastic however it would be better if you allowed more sorting abilities for albums pictures and videos
guid	1	smth	t would be good if there was more sorting (either via the photo hub or via code) which allows all items to be sorted title\creation timestamp\last updated timestamp ascending\descending
guid	1	smth	leas allow in the WMappmanifest a selection box to force legacy resume mode so my WP81 app can function just as it did in WP8
guid	1	smth	owever there should be more of swipe gestures than the tap methods
guid	1	smth	o set a difference a swipe to the right should launch 'settings' menu as a swipe to the left launches the 'apps list'
guid	1	smth	lesae implement Windows.ApplicationModel.SuspendingDeferral as IDisposable (probably already declared in ISuspendingDeferral) and call method Complete() from within IDisposable.Dispose() to simplify its usage
guid	1	smth	ey I thought it would be really useful if users could add a homepage to their Internet Explorer for their WP like they would on a desktop/P
guid	1	smth	M apps could have custom keyboards or more fun ways of inputting data could be used
guid	0	smth	hen you connect an iPhone to a mac you can view the webview from Safari by going to Develop->Debug
guid	1	smth	ith frameworks like Angular Node jQuery etc becoming more popular we really need means to debug our apps to provide the best web experience
guid	0	smth	ndroid has third-party apps that can block your apps/games with a password
guid	1	smth	 would like to get Short videos in fullscreen instead of picture on Lockscreen
guid	1	smth	 hope you like the idea i bet many people would like to have spinning earthwind blowingriver streamingwaterfallsetc on their lockscreen
guid	0	smth	herefore if you want to detect horizontal swipe manipulations in a Vertical scrolling ScrollViewer (for a custom ListView Item horizontal sliding animation implementation for example) it simply cannot be done
guid	1	smth	n my opinion it is essential to have true multi-touch support for standard controls at least in Universal Applications
guid	1	smth	lease extend Song Class with more useful properties such as LastPlayedDate AddedDate
guid	1	smth	ut why not allow it to be used locally by sideloading or through the emulators
guid	1	smth	t would be great if you would add a RemoteId to the calendars
guid	1	smth	 think there should be a casual genre section as a lot of apps don't fall into any specific section already listed
guid	0	smth	or example timer and alarm apps
guid	1	smth	t would be nice if more recent reviews would have more weight in the total score of the app
guid	1	smth	lease make bookmarks for podcasts persistent after moving to another podcast and coming back
guid	1	smth	t would be nice to be able to render XAML that is not on the visual tree and perhaps in a background task
guid	1	smth	e should be able to use descriptive text overlays in our screenshots it allows us to better point out what the screenshot is showing
guid	0	smth	or some reason entering a number with a * at the front in to the dialler task in an app in WP7.5 WP8.0 or WP8.1 results in the message Please enter service codes directly from the phone's keypad
guid	1	smth	t would be helpful to be able to launch the calendar for a specific day i.e I tell the user you have x appointments today - Would you like to review them 
guid	1	smth	t would be cool to allow the ApplicationBar to have more icons available
guid	1	smth	hen will the alarm feature be implemented in winrt to support the phone
guid	1	smth	t would be greater if we could disable the close function while doing important tasks like writing to the storage or similar
guid	1	smth	lease enable removing language code from the Dev Center language histor
guid	1	smth	t should be an option to remove the ru language code from my app 'language History' or an option to completly replace: Fully replace the prevoius(es) xap(s)
guid	0	smth	etting the Geolocator to actually do something requires getting the magical (and undocumented) setting of properties correct and then attaching event handler
guid	1	smth	t would be extremely helpful if the reminder/alarm API supported creating a reminder for specific days of the week
guid	1	smth	he trial feature should be built-in with automatic enforcement user prompting disabling etc just as it is in the Windows Store
guid	0	smth	ontrast this with the Windows Phone world where the developer indicates trial mode in the store but has to manually track the number of days since install whether the user has purchased etc
guid	1	smth	hen submitting an app the store submission process should prompt you to link to documentation for any URI schemes your app includes in the manifest file or mark them as private URIs if you don't want to document them
guid	1	smth	urrently the best place to find documentation for URI schemes is the Nokia Dev Wiki http://bit.ly/NokiaUriSchemes but this information should really be available though Microsoft
guid	0	smth	bove could save hours spent on reading wrong answer
guid	1	smth	here need to be a business app settings launcher native in the API
guid	1	smth	here must be a way to handle this kind of problem like statistics on how many times an app was started or not being able to start applications other than some basic apps
guid	0	smth	urrently (as of 8.1) when there is an embedded video in a WebView and the user presses the fullscreen button the video expands to only the extents of the WebView; which isn't fullscreen if the WebView is surrounded by other controls
guid	1	smth	here should be a property on the WebView that controls the fullscreen behavior such that it is possible to fill the entire viewable area of the display with the video and its controls
guid	1	smth	ave an API for an application to interact with and listen for incomming connections from paired bluetooth devices while in background
guid	1	smth	t will be very useful if user can scan custom QR code from other screen or poster from phone Search / Vision function and launch app via associated URI saved in QR code
guid	1	smth	n HTTP-based API with a program-friendly logon (e. g. OAuth) would be most welcome
guid	0	smth	here is no good reason for not allowing this so please add it
guid	0	smth	veryone in the USA has nice upload speeds possibly but not worldwide and I presume Microsoft would wish to enable developers from other countries also to be able to use their dev center
guid	1	smth	ust remove the timeouts completely or at least increase all timeouts by a factor of at least 5 - its not a big deal to implement
guid	1	smth	o go 1 step further making the support email process anonymous would probably convince more people to use the support system
guid	1	smth	et up a brokerage system whereby the developer never sees the users live email address and instead replies to a proxy email set up per-user
guid	1	smth	rial feature should be built-in with auto-prompted and disabling just like the Windows Store
guid	1	smth	s it possible to create a traffic counter that can show how many traffic I have by wifi or by gms (lte)
guid	1	smth	he reminder function in the wp8 calendar must be expand to more weekly options
guid	1	smth	imilarly this idea could be thought through for integration of One Note with other Native applications like Camera Messaging et
guid	1	smth	t would be very useful to be able to prepair a MMSComposeTask in the same way that we today could use the SMSComposeTask 
guid	0	smth	e would like to create an app to monitor the time users spend in other the apps enabling enterprise customers to optimize a user's day by analyzing time on applications
guid	1	smth	 would like to have an option for each SkyDrive folder to make them available offline
guid	0	smth	o those folders could be downloaded completely to the phone when a Wi-Fi is available to access them offline later
guid	1	smth	indows should allow additional user accounts added to track & review the application review process similar to what Apple and Android apple stores allow
guid	1	smth	lease to have competitive advantage i would like you to provide an expedite package for app certification for developers who wants their apps to be published fast
guid	1	smth	aving users enroll their phone using the same mdm client no matter the vendor is a nice idea
guid	1	smth	an we have an API to enroll the device through an app or allow mdm enrollment to initiate through a browser download
guid	1	smth	f you are concerned about security reasons a good implementation of this API would be to always notify the user that a message from that application has been sent and where it was sent
guid	0	smth	e now need to add extra code to reposition it at the top after it has been loaded
guid	1	smth	'd suggest to include all Transactions in the Report
guid	1	smth	ll uesr want to find fast their contact when they must call so it's very good to insert the fast search on phone dialer it's good that the user can choose the better method to search like name or/and surname or/and Address etc..
guid	0	smth	 think it's good that 3th apps can access to the list of installed apps and can decide to unistall or freeze or lock etc..
guid	1	smth	llow downloading of submissioned .xap files in Windows Phone application publish submission process
guid	1	smth	lease make kids corner as a another account
guid	1	smth	llow debit cards as a payment instrument for registration and renewal
guid	1	smth	ould be great to discover Service Hosts in local Networks
guid	1	smth	ould also be helpful in it's own right for general localization testing to verify that localized strings have messed up layout
guid	0	smth	s a developer the only way to increase app ratings and review is to prompt user
guid	1	smth	 was expecting some notification center on the site so that i can see what new things have happened over my account since my last visit
guid	1	smth	 want in WP8 back (it stiill works in WP7) that I can set a color for ApplicationBar Icons
guid	1	smth	sn't it better to allow developers to change their app name inside app store according to different language and culture
guid	0	smth	his would be very useful in the resource constrained environment of a phone
guid	1	smth	) Allow more code to be shared across platforms an
guid	1	smth	 would also be nice to be able to retain some kind of unique key the app could store or some other way the app can have a way to query 'to-do' items that the app created
guid	1	smth	 shared key chain to share data between the apps this help in apps with features like SS
guid	1	smth	nclude support for pen input like on the surface pro and surface pro 2 for both WP8 and R
guid	1	smth	ake it possible to optionally declare a function OnClick() for live tiles such that this code is executed when the live tiles is presed without leaving the home screen
guid	1	smth	llow the phone to be used as a mini presentation device
guid	0	smth	his can allow the phone to be used as a secondary display or project the screen contents on for example Push2TV devices or Widi Receiver
guid	1	smth	lease Make it possible to build WP7 / 7.5 Apps :
guid	1	smth	he app should have more advanced options for scheduling when and how often it will run in the background perhaps by setting a different interval for different days of the week or times of the day or by specifying the time until it will run again each time it runs
guid	1	smth	urthermore the 25 second duration should be expanded to at least 60 seconds to account for larger data transfers and slower network connections
guid	0	smth	his is also a capability that other mobile platforms have and I think it is needed to build quality apps with a good user experience
guid	1	smth	pps should get at least 60 seconds of background processing time to complete such network transfers and process the response
guid	0	smth	n my opinion Chinese app are mainly design for Chinese and handsets are mostly from China Market.. Its may be challenging for developers to get phones from different countries or regions
guid	1	smth	aving said these I propose such feature of prompting to do a language pack installation to be on the Windows Phone OS level when user switches language
guid	1	smth	aving said these i thought a feature for prompting user installing language pack done on phone OS level would be good
guid	1	smth	f we use diferent datatemplates why not make every panel virtualizable
guid	1	smth	or example I would love it if my GPS app could turn location on when the app starts and turn it back off when the app exits
guid	1	smth	n developer should have an option or tool to manage that list and select which ones are displayed
guid	1	smth	nder this suggestion the developer should be unable to manage or modify the base/standard images this suggestion is only for adding additional images
guid	1	smth	he Windows Phone emulator should include the ability to manage VM snapshots for Windows Phone images
guid	0	smth	f you want to load content after you reach the end of a list you have to write your own user control or create data bindings
guid	1	smth	f NavigationService.Navigate() would let us pass a parameter of type object along with the URI it will help us to keep less states objects in the App class which will become a mess as project grows
guid	1	smth	lease provide a PhotoCropTask that takes an Image(Byte[]) and provides the same crop tool
guid	1	smth	nclude a PixelHeight and PixelWidth as optional parameters so an aspect ratio can be included
guid	0	smth	his would allow for Picture cropping
guid	1	smth	rovide an API(s) that allow apps to either control Settings (eg being able to toggle WiFi when NFC tag is interacted)
guid	1	smth	lso it would be nice if there was an API that allowed an app to be integrated into the Settings Applets instead of a standard app
guid	1	smth	'd like to see the Windows App store be similar to Google where I can skip the hassle and headache of certification and just get an app on the store in hours not days
guid	1	smth	llow us developers to renew our expired subscriptions
guid	0	smth	've asked the support they said me that I have to create another subscription with another live account and after it ask them to migrate apps and related data
guid	0	smth	t's not healthy to keep several accounts that means nothing specially ones that you just had to create because you need to renew the subscriptio
guid	1	smth	lease provide any idea about background service in wm8 as gps tracking automatically
guid	0	smth	f Windows Phone as any faith in its future it needs a lot more support from the development team
guid	1	smth	f you want people to develop apps you need to offer a dev platform that doesn't only run on the latest and greatest machines
guid	1	smth	e miss a control like the integrated photo viewer to show photos or any controls page by page by using flick gestures
guid	1	smth	t should be an option to remove the ru language code from my app 'language History'
guid	0	smth	- You can publish an update with the removed ru language but this update will not fully replace the old version and you will in truble
guid	1	smth	 think Placement should be splitted in HorizontalPlacement (Left Center Right) and VerticalPlacement (Top Bottom) to have more flexibility
guid	1	smth	 would like to have a reminder system (API) that allows me to know if the phone is near a phone from a friend (location based)
guid	0	smth	xample: Remind me to ask Holly about the project status when I meet her the next time
guid	0	smth	 think this will be the wrong way
guid	0	smth	I am a professional software engineer and I am developing with Visual Studio at work So I thougt its a goot idea to buy a windows phone because I could develop some phone applications
guid	1	smth	t would be very convenient to just click a button and have your app placed in only the markets that we do not need to worry about taxes
guid	0	smth	ince changing is not an option you will need to create a new account within the Turkey region

guid	0	smth	 want my UWP UI to look the same across any screen of the same resolution regardless of the scale factor applied by Windows

guid	0	smth	his application is far too complex for mobile screens and 500 x 500 is too small
guid	0	smth	s this an option we can hope for in the near future
guid	0	smth	he default MenuFlyoutSubItem allows you to add subitems either through XAML or the Items code behind property
guid	0	smth	'm currently trying to convert an application that contains some of the CoreUtils utilities (most notably [.exe and ].exe)

guid	0	smth	ooking at the VfsOps.ps1 file it seems that the Test-Path on line 138 assumes that the file path is a standard wildcard not a file name
guid	0	smth	ooks like it could be fixed by adding [Management.Automation.WildcardPattern]::Escape(...) somewhere but I haven't been able to find out how to make the catalog writeable so that I can test this..

guid	0	smth	rbit View Currently have 2D plane so for Mixed Reality Apps third Dimension needed to expand it functionality
guid	0	smth	ike for example for Space apps where Earth have satellites NEO and space stations and they all have orbits based on earth so orbital view in 3D make it better in Mixed realit
guid	0	smth	s there some sort of bug tracker for Microsoft software
guid	0	smth	inda like UserVoice but for bug reports
guid	0	smth	 have an app that works normally but when launched via the Desktop Bridge there's some strange issues with COM
guid	0	smth	hat does the Desktop Bridge do differently
guid	0	smth	oreApplication now has a RequestRestartAsync method but it fails in a Desktop Bridge app with NotInForeground
guid	0	smth	 wonder if this is because of the way the Desktop Bridge technology wraps the WPF application
guid	0	smth	ny ideas on how I can cause the app to restart
guid	0	smth	owever collapsing a pivot item does not remove it from the UI visual tree
guid	0	smth	he header still 'exists' and is keyboard focus-able
guid	0	smth	ince you can correctly hide ListBoxItems I'm considering this a bug
guid	0	smth	epeatedly calling MediaPlayer.StepForwardOneFrame() `MediaPlayer.StepBackOneFrame() should switch between two frames but video is moving slightly back
guid	0	smth	t first this isn't an issue since the control isn't Visible
guid	0	smth	owever if you make the parent visible binding will not be triggered and you must manually force an update to get bound values to appear
guid	0	smth	his was probably done as a performance optimization; however binding needs to recognize visibility changes if it won't bind when an item is not visible in the UI
guid	0	smth	therwise yet again MVVM is broken
guid	0	smth	 have a UWP UserControl line chart that renders a PathFigure to a Canvas
guid	0	smth	his chart supports zooming and the PathFigure size is changed during zoom but clipped within the visible Chart area
guid	0	smth	t high zoom levels (above 300%) the entire UWP app will crash with a native exception: An unhandled win32 exception occured in <app> [17800
guid	0	smth	here must be a bug some place in the framework
guid	0	smth	his crash only happens using the Fall Creators Update after the clipping issue was fixed
guid	0	smth	'm guessing it's a numerical overflow somewhere deep in the graphics stack
guid	0	smth	rom my viewpoint I think there is no way in managed code I should be getting a native exception like this
guid	0	smth	he following Hyper-V networking Configuration breaks DNS name resolution on the Virtual Machine
guid	0	smth	onnecting the host to a non-corporate (remote) WiFi network
guid	0	smth	hen a VM is connected to the default switch and the host is connected to the corporate network via Cisco AnyConnect the VM looses the ability to resolve DNS addresses
guid	0	smth	he VM is able to ping both public addresses and corporate addresses; however it is unable to resolve names on either the public internet or corporate network
guid	0	smth	his issue was submitted as a MS Premier support ticket (https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/commercial/incidents/117111417156306) and a Connect bug (https://connect.microsoft.com/WindowsServer/feedback/details/3142497/build-16299-15-hyper-v-default-switch-nat-name-resolution-not-working)

guid	0	smth	sing the fall creator's update version of UWP it seems that when a data context is changed to a new view model the previous view model is updated with null values
guid	0	smth	his is the same as if the DataContext is set to null before changing view models
guid	0	smth	t doesn't make sense why the bound values are updated when the DataContext is changed
guid	0	smth	n stack overflow or any other forums we have option to add multiple tags related to our question
guid	0	smth	urrently is not possibile to create a new Calendar inside an Enterprise Exchange user account
guid	0	smth	t's only allowed to create an app calendar which lives on local devic
guid	0	smth	he Windows.Services.Store namespace does not provide a class that you can use to simulate license info during testing
guid	0	smth	t the moment a VSTO add-in cannot be published on Windows Store or on Office Store
guid	1	smth	n idea could be extending Desktop App Converter tool in order to manage VSTO add-in
guid	0	smth	 reported that since studio 15.4.3 the designer crash due to attached propertie
guid	0	smth	hanging to last UWP solve the designer problem; but the attached properties are not working (the binding) and I have to do set binding by cod
guid	0	smth	hile understandable that there are big challenges to overcome to make this possible but currently the bar to create optional packages is too high due that the time investment and issues that can occur makes it not that worh it due the C++ requirement
guid	0	smth	he CreateStreamedFileAsync() method is there since Windows 8 to delay creation of file data
guid	0	smth	owever when using the result in a Drag+Drop or Clipboard operation Windows Explorer errors out with 0x80004002 No such interface supported
guid	0	smth	t can be used between UWP apps but not in Windows Explorer which really is a shame
guid	0	smth	here are desktop Win32 APIs for delay creation of files that are used heavily e.g
guid	0	smth	n WinZIP and similar applications to delay actual unzip of files until really required but they cannot be used in UWP
guid	1	smth	lease support the UWP equivalent called CreateStreamedFileAsync in Windows Explorer
guid	0	smth	hings like MinConnectionInterval MaxConnectionInterval SlaveLatency and Connection Supervisory Timeou
guid	0	smth	t is a compendium of various PDF viewer tutorials rolled into a single user control
guid	0	smth	 have no doubt it could be improved by community involvement
guid	0	smth	he documentation may be found here
guid	0	smth	n given example of the API can be seen below
guid	0	smth	nder UWP it is still not possible to open a folder or file out of the sandbox
guid	0	smth	ven to suggest a path is not possible
guid	0	smth	o your are not able to suggest a folder or file to the user by a path-string
guid	0	smth	o at the moment i have to tell my customers: open the folder-picker and navigate from the pictures-library to the path:D:\very long path..\final_folder
guid	0	smth	nd thereby... the folderpicker has no preview to the content in a folder
guid	0	smth	ctual implementing an selection of file or folder in UWP (how easy but stupid
guid	0	smth	o picker.SuggestedStartLocation is not a string to a path but only a selection of libraries
guid	0	smth	oes microsoft really believe that users and developers accept that lowest budget setup
guid	0	smth	ow after the great Windows 10 Fall Creators Update it is still a joke to switch and develop to UWP
guid	0	smth	oes anybody at MS have an idea how to propose an path in an UWP application
guid	0	smth	e'll currently I have a Uwp app that needs to call a web.api service that is secured with azure ad
guid	0	smth	 have been looking for samples and tutorials to do this and I have found some
guid	0	smth	 have created AppPinManager helper class  just call those helper fuunction  it will takecare to add into the startmenu or TaskBa
guid	0	smth	or example a long running task where the user is not allowed to back out until it completes
guid	1	smth	urrently UWP Community Toolkit includes seven services that are very useful but more is always better it would be awesome to add more and more services including a big one for a lot of people WordPress
guid	0	smth	o clarify that this can be done from Windows 10 as a part of Windows administration and configuration for instance via Group Policies PowerShell Windows Updates Schedule Tasks etc
guid	0	smth	here are several issues with the file activation NeighboringFilesQuery argument and the file system indexer
guid	0	smth	f files are loaded using the NeighboringFilesQuery then GetPropertiesAsync on those files will only return properties that have been indexed
guid	0	smth	his prevents reading things like altitude from the GPS location data
guid	0	smth	he above is made a lot worse on computers where indexing file content is disabled (right click on the drive in Explorer select properties and see check box at the bottom) which used to be recommended for SSD drives
guid	0	smth	n particular no ImageProperties are available in this case
guid	0	smth	t also happens if the indexer isn't working properly (which is not uncommon)
guid	0	smth	f the indexer is really broken (for some reason this started happening on my PC so is not uncommon) then it will fail to pick up any neighboring files at all (confirmed by using the default Photos app to open a photo in a folder with lots of photos and it only showed one photo)
guid	0	smth	 don't think this is a security issue because the data is in the file and the file contents are readable
guid	0	smth	his will enable automatic testing on hybrid windows apps where DOM inspection is necessary
guid	0	smth	hen setting ToolTipService.Placement to Mouse the text in the tooltip is no longer sharp
guid	0	smth	t looks like the tooltip is not perfectly aligned to the device pixels but rather half a pixel off vertically
guid	0	smth	his is on Windows 10 Fall Creators Update (build 16299.19) @ 150% DPI scale the app targets Windows 10 SDK 16299
guid	0	smth	ould be a lot more intuitive useful and less distractive then the current overlay
guid	0	smth	he way ink Input is currently handled is sooo Win32 ;) I know there is InkCanvas and Windows.UI.Input.Inking.Analysis put this should be build into the text controls in a standard way
guid	1	smth	magine writing text directly into the TextBox or RichEditBox canvas without the Ink-Keyboard-Overlay
guid	0	smth	t limits the use case of MasterView
guid	0	smth	e can't use Pivot Semantic Zoom GridView PullToRefresh SlidableListItem and more
guid	0	smth	on't fake the page navigation using Storyboard
guid	0	smth	t now gets a number of linker problems that are being caused by Microsoft components
guid	0	smth	alling this method would throw exception at runtime
guid	1	smth	f for some reason your P/Invoke does not satisfy those requirements please use [DllImport(ExactSpelling=true) to indicate that you understand the implications of using non-UWP API
guid	0	smth	 don't call this function
guid	0	smth	hen I traced down some new crashes I found that Socket.ConnectAsync is trying to call this function and failing because it doesn't exist
guid	0	smth	 have about 15-20 similar errors in the build that are referencing things I don't directly call
guid	0	smth	've reverted to .Net.Native 1.7 until this gets fixed
guid	0	smth	n Windows Forms toolkit there is a handy control called the NumericUpDownControl
guid	1	smth	urrent appextension only supports loading assets and scripts
guid	1	smth	n many scenarios 3rd party author may provide some code actable with the main app for example decoding another file format
guid	0	smth	f you change the DataPackageOperation to Copy the problem goes away
guid	0	smth	e are experiencing an issue where the presence of a PasswordBox with a NumericPin InputScope overrides the InputScope of other controls on the page--until the PasswordBox has received focus
guid	0	smth	n a touch screen this manifests every time a user reaches the first page in our UWP App that has a NumericPin-scoped PasswordBox
guid	0	smth	) Build and run the ap
guid	0	smth	) See that the touch keyboard is the NumericPin keyboard even though the focused TextBox should have the default InputScope
guid	0	smth	) Click into TextBox 2
guid	0	smth	eyboard remains NumericPin
guid	0	smth	0) See that the InputScopes of the TextBoxes are now honored
guid	0	smth	) Add the XAML below to MainPage.xam
guid	0	smth	) Before doing anything else click the Show touch keyboard button in the notification tray such that the touch keyboard appears
guid	0	smth	 think I found a problem in Media Player
guid	0	smth	he problem happens on phone if media player is paused from another media app
guid	0	smth	n this case will be fired only MediaPlayer.PlaybackSession.PlaybackStateChanged event and it is not possible to detect whether app was paused through user or system
guid	0	smth	ut if phone calls then will be simulated SystemMediaTransportControls pause button click (MediaPlayer.SystemMediaTransportControls.ButtonPressed event) and on phone call I can correctly stop my player and change some states
guid	0	smth	 am preloading images for speed and I need to release the memory immediately when no longer needed to prevent memory failures but setting the reference to null and even calling GC.Collect() immediately does not always result in an immediate release of memory
guid	0	smth	've looked into using a SoftwareBitmapSource instead but this is a lot slower and uses more memory and I'm not 100% sure whether its Dispose method works (doesn't affect memory shown in VS debugger but did seem to have an effect when testing using a mobile emulator)
guid	0	smth	ompact overlay window is always shown at the right-top corner
guid	0	smth	onditional check doesn't actually solve the problem it doesn't suit the control like NavigationView since at the end developer still have to create a NavigationView with SplitView which is really pain to maintain
guid	0	smth	ore details can be found in this issue https://github.com/Microsoft/WindowsUIDevLabs/issues/15
guid	0	smth	e can see the support of communities in UWPCommunityToolkit
guid	0	smth	s a self-learner it is very hard to find a tutorial to learn new things
guid	0	smth	apControl has some nice extensibility options but requires specifying a token even if you're using local or custom tile sources as the background replacement layer
guid	0	smth	 hear a lot about “clean uninstall” but we noticed a few months ago appx leaves some stuff behind
guid	0	smth	pecifically persisted appframe window sizing data remains behind potentially leaving the user/dev in a potential bad or confusing window state
guid	0	smth	ee the data piling up in the following stores
guid	0	smth	 lot of small time developers like myself don't have the means to use the Microsoft Store to host their apps
guid	0	smth	 develop applications for the military and the IT department barely has any idea what they're doing
guid	0	smth	in32 apps still dominate because they're so robust and developed
guid	0	smth	o bring in new and old developers bring back the same functionality that is found in WPF and Winforms
guid	0	smth	ssume the following XAML: and not calling SetDesiredBounds
guid	0	smth	his is what the screen looks like: https://1drv.ms/i/s!AqT0PAFUIw04htwcFjitFI7iNTXl5
guid	0	smth	sorry for the photo could not do a regular screen shot at the moment!
guid	0	smth	ooks good
guid	0	smth	es video and transport controls cover the entire media player
guid	0	smth	n full screen transport controls (not video) do also respect the safe area
guid	0	smth	therwise this looks cut and incomplete
guid	0	smth	o far so good
guid	0	smth	ow let's turn on DesiredBoundsMode
guid	0	smth	he safe area is removed... and it looks like the following: https://1drv.ms/i/s!AqT0PAFUIw04htwdhtSgx38PFkcWe
guid	0	smth	age has no more safe area BUT on the transport controls have suddenly the safe area even though the media player is part WITHIN the page
guid	0	smth	For full screen it remains the same framed version as before so no additional screen shot) Why are transport controls no longer covering the entire video
guid	0	smth	hat's an real issue
guid	0	smth	 am removing the safe area by calling SetDesiredBounds and I am experiencing framed transport controls then even when using as control somewhere within the page
guid	0	smth	 debugged this a lot and found a solution (and realized a very dirty hack by Microsoft)
guid	0	smth	n my app I am using custom transport controls and I used the original template as a starting point
guid	0	smth	 found out that there is a <grid> element with x:name=ControlPanelGrid and on Xbox it gets magically a margin of 480482
guid	0	smth	his is documented nowhere and has the bad effect described above
guid	0	smth	emoving the x:name or renaming that element is enough the margin is gone
guid	0	smth	evertheless I would expect a less hacky solution
guid	0	smth	aving a safe-area within a media element's transport controls when not full-screen is definitely a bug
guid	0	smth	nd fiddling arround with a grid by name is just a dirty hack since this does not work with custom transport controls as long as the magic grid with it's name is not present
guid	0	smth	he MediaPlayerElement supports various subtitle formats
guid	0	smth	ut when we play a video file using MediaStreamSource it is not possible to pass through the subtitle streams because we cannot create MediaStreamDescriptors for them
guid	0	smth	o audio and video works but subtitles don't work
guid	0	smth	his would be very helpful to make the MS initiated FFmpegInterop truly unviersally useful
guid	0	smth	 am unable to use containers and VmWare/VirtualBox on Windows 10 at the same time due to the restriction of Hyper-V
guid	0	smth	his restriction does not exist on Linux and MacOS
guid	0	smth	hy force me to reboot to disable/enable Hyper-V
guid	0	smth	hy does Hyper-V lock out other virtualization software
guid	0	smth	he WPF UniformGrid (https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.controls.primitives.uniformgrid(v=vs.110).aspx) is missing in UWP
guid	0	smth	t doesn't seem to quite have an equivalent in UWP in order to get even spacing of a grid automatically as well as other features like setting rows/columns and first column for calendar type applications

guid	0	smth	pple announced support for Fragmented MP4 backed HLS Streams under HLS version 7: https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2016/504/ at WWDC 2016
guid	0	smth	e are looking to change the way our HLS streams are generated and Windows seems to be one of the few platforms that doesn't support playing these type of streams
guid	0	smth	 have to make a stub of the class in the local project which causes duplicate of code
guid	0	smth	 submitted this to the VS forum but they said to post the issue here
guid	0	smth	e now have this option for ListView and GridView but not for the ComboBox control
guid	0	smth	he StreamSocket class has no good way of polling the connection status without sending data (your connection may have died minutes ago but you won't know until you try to send something which isn't desirable)
guid	0	smth	any of the old implementations in .Net and even in VB6 socket control had this functionality (and it was highly useful)
guid	1	smth	he proposal is to add something like:  // Something happened update your UI or run your business logi
guid	0	smth	hile downloading a file with BackgroundDownloader the progress updates every 1MB which is not really accurate
guid	0	smth	've noticed that pausing and resuming the download accelerates the update rate to about every 250 ms
guid	0	smth	his would allow us to easily use different ItemTemplates for each group in conjunction with GroupStyleSelector
guid	0	smth	here are many cases where you have different kind of data and group them by data type
guid	0	smth	r you display search results for various item types in one view
guid	0	smth	t is possiblte to achieve this right now using the normal ItemTemplateSelector on ListView/GridView
guid	0	smth	ut it causes a context switch from native->.net and back for each item which will slow down the control when showing a lot of items (this is noticeable on slow devices or phones)
guid	0	smth	lus as I read in the docs this can degrade virtualization performace as the control does not know upfront which items need which template
guid	0	smth	ow the control does not need to call selector for every item speeding up the control
guid	0	smth	esktop Bridge attracts me as a developer but Windows Store puts me off
guid	0	smth	urrently the only way to find programs are if you type their names
guid	0	smth	here are no keyword searches
guid	0	smth	his has been like that for many years but no one has done anything about it
guid	0	smth	f you wonder why developers are not jumping on to something as attractive as Desktop Bridge this is the reason
guid	0	smth	here are many threads on Internet discussing this issue but Windows Store team doesn't seem to listen
guid	0	smth	therwise the private store can only be used for in-house apps or free apps
guid	0	smth	 content control that enables the user to use inking to enter text in TextBoxes (including RichEditBox
guid	0	smth	ach JavaScript app that uses a Video element in the UI and calls the play() function to stream the video preview from camera to the app page will Crash after recent Windows 10 update 10.0.15063.60
guid	0	smth	his crash occurs in all JavaScript apps that use the MediaCapture API to display camera Video previews
guid	0	smth	or this reason apps programmed in JavaScript that use Video or photo capturing are from now on non-functional in Windows 10

guid	0	smth	o for the CalendarView.SelectedDatesChanged event the following signature works
guid	0	smth	his behavior is not found in public documentation
guid	0	smth	ut I couldn't find any option in my dev center account to support this functionality
guid	0	smth	n DX11 you can't read and write to the same texture and that's fine I can live with that
guid	0	smth	owever the API was designed that it will introduce severe overhead in the following scenario
guid	0	smth	hese objects are semi-transparent (alpha-blending) so I need to draw them sorted by distance to camera (back to front) and not by state changes
guid	0	smth	et's assume I have 50 objects which are Soft Particles (SP
guid	0	smth	nd 50 objects that are triangle meshes (TM
guid	0	smth	P don't do depth writes but they do depth-tests and depth reads in the shader
guid	0	smth	M do depth writes and depth tests but they don't do depth reads in the shader
guid	0	smth	y depth writes I mean the D3D11_DEPTH_STENCIL_DESC.DepthWriteMas
guid	0	smth	owever in the worst case when SP and TM are ordered in the following way
guid	0	smth	 have to change the depth stencil view using OMSetRenderTargets for each draw call to set the same depth texture but with view that has D3D11_DSV_READ_ONLY_DEPTH enabled or disabled
guid	0	smth	o in order to draw them all I have to do
guid	0	smth	o my understanding OMSetRenderTargets is a slow operation but I need to call it 100 times
guid	0	smth	I don't need to create 2 depth stencil views for each depth buffer (one with D3D11_DSV_READ_ONLY_DEPTH enabled and one with disabled
guid	0	smth	I don't need to call OMSetRenderTargets for each draw call where I want to change D3D11_DSV_READ_ONLY_DEPTH
guid	0	smth	ut I just stick to normal depth writes D3D11_DEPTH_STENCIL_DESC.DepthWriteMas
guid	0	smth	his artificial limitation is also the cause for bugs in WebGL 2 in Chrome/FireFox
guid	0	smth	nce you start working on WebGL 2 in MS Edge you will notice that you will encounter the same problem because in GLES3/WebGL2 it's legal to read from the depth texture while it's bound to the FBO and you will have to do checks for each draw call if depth stencil view needs to be changed to have D3D11_DSV_READ_ONLY_DEPTH or no

guid	0	smth	 don't want all the time contact support wait wait wait and yeah we have issues or now is just Saturday...I've to wait til Monday
guid	0	smth	ith service issue I mean devcenter backend is down or doesn't work properly in some ways
guid	0	smth	t least we're not totally in the dark in a limbo where we don't know if the issue is just a transient one or a serious one and we have to way days
guid	0	smth	apControl crashing whole App with the following stacktrace

guid	0	smth	his would allow the app to process messages asynchronously without pairing
guid	0	smth	ome devices/apps do not have the ability of input (pairing/password)
guid	0	smth	he main impediments when creating a Chat-like control using a ListView is that we don't have a native way to handle incrementalLoading at the top of list
guid	1	smth	here is already an example we can reuse in UWP samples https://github.com/Microsoft/Windows-universal-samples/tree/master/Samples/XamlBottomUpLis

guid	0	smth	f it works in Edge Chrome and Firefox it should work in WebView control
guid	0	smth	ot sure why even having a web browser control if it isn't going to have full browser features (minus the tabs settings URL input box etc
guid	0	smth	ince Edge doesn't support lockdown usage (like IE did with Kiosk mode) it makes it even more important to have this
guid	0	smth	 add a CustomAudioEffect which is EQ (I've also tried using official UWP sample's EchoEffect) to MediaPlayer
guid	0	smth	lthough it seems CustomAudioEffect is running on Worker thread not UI thread it seems media playback would also be impact when UI loading a bit heavier
guid	0	smth	 could hear my music become intermittently
guid	1	smth	ow that Xaml and DirectX support SVG images I'd love to provide my splash screen image as an SVG file
guid	0	smth	o often the png splash screen is larger than all of the app's compiled code
guid	0	smth	I'd also be OK using a Xaml Path.
guid	0	smth	pple has such a form and on the few occasions that I've needed to use it they've generally completed a review in a few hours
guid	0	smth	his is useful for situations where a critical security flaw is identified or where a trade show or other immovable deadline requires an app get through the review process more quickly than usual
